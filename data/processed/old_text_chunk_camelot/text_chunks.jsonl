Business (Continued)\nOVERVIEW\nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and other activities.\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\nThe Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, and accessories\nworldwide, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute, and service the vehicles, parts, and\naccessories. This segment includes revenues and costs related to our electrification vehicle programs. The segment\nincludes the following regional business units: North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the\nInternational Markets Group.\nGeneral\nOur vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln. In 2021, we sold approximately 3,942,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout\nthe world. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations\u201d (\u201cItem 7\u201d) for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes.\nSubstantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively,\n\u201cdealerships\u201d), the substantial majority of which are independently owned. At December 31, the approximate number of\ndealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows:\nBrand 2020 2021\nFord 9,618 8,900\nFord-Lincoln (combined) 707 654\nLincoln 392 401\nTotal 10,717 9,955\nWe do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to\nfleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. We also sell parts\nand accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which, in turn, sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized\nparts distributors (which, in turn, primarily sell these products to retailers). We also offer extended service contracts.\nThe worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we\nhave little control. Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and\nwhen to replace an existing vehicle. The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing\neconomic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars, trucks, and\nutility vehicles and the availability and cost of financing and fuel). As a result, the number of cars, trucks, and utility\nvehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year. Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business\nthat has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers.\n2\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 66 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 3, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nOur wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand. Our\nwholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory, and our ability to maintain sufficient production\nlevels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our\nproduction. Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by\nother manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality,\nand reputation. Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions. Our ability to satisfy\nchanging consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance\ncharacteristics, affects our sales and earnings significantly.\nAs with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022 Wholesale unit volumes\n\u2022 Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which, in turn, is affected by many factors, such as:\n\u25e6 Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors,\nincentive programs)\n\u25e6 Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles\n\u25e6 Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions\n\u25e6 Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment\n\u2022 A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can\nsignificantly affect overall profitability\nOur industry has a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by industry excess capacity. For the past\nseveral decades, manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for\ncustomers and maintain market share and production levels. The decline in value of foreign currencies in the past has\ncontributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets. The U.S. administration has sought to address\nthis issue with currency provisions that were included in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and United States-\nChina trade deals.\nCompetitive Position. The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant\nproducer. Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries,\nespecially their countries of origin.\nSeasonality. We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales\n(i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in\ninventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers). Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in\nthe business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the\nspring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year). Because of constraints related to COVID-19 in\n2020 and, more recently, due to the semiconductor shortage, production has been higher in the second half of the year.\nBacklog Orders. During the past year, gross stock levels at dealers were lower than normal due largely to the\nsemiconductor shortage, and the amount of time required to fill orders for certain vehicles increased.\nRaw Materials. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the\nproduction of, and development of technologies in, our vehicles. These materials include base metals (e.g., steel and\naluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene). As we\ntransition to a greater mix of battery electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, and nickel for\nbatteries. We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs;\nhowever, there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact availability\nin sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs. See the \u201cKey Trends and Economic Factors\nAffecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\u201d section of Item 7 for a discussion of supplier disruptions caused by a shortage\nof key components, as well as commodity and energy price changes, and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk\u201d (\u201cItem 7A\u201d) for a discussion of commodity price risks.\nIntellectual Property. We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks on\na global basis. We expect to continue building this portfolio as we actively pursue innovation in every part of our\nbusiness. We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our\nCompany and its products and services globally. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to\nthe operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration\nof any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property agreement.\n3\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 77 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 6, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nMOBILITY SEGMENT\nEffective January 1, 2021, we realigned the costs and benefits related to enterprise connectivity activities previously\nincluded in the Mobility segment to the Automotive segment. Accordingly, the Mobility segment primarily includes\ndevelopment costs for Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicles and related businesses, Ford\u2019s equity ownership in Argo AI (a\ndeveloper of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and investments.\nFORD CREDIT SEGMENT\nThe Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis, which is primarily vehicle-\nrelated financing and leasing activities.\nFord Credit offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the\nworld. The predominant share of Ford Credit\u2019s business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our\ndealers. Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease\n(retail financing) and operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases; interest rate supplements and other\nsupport payments from us and our affiliates; and payments made under dealer financing programs.\nAs a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases\nwhich it classifies into two portfolios\u2014\u201cconsumer\u201d and \u201cnon-consumer.\u201d Finance receivables and operating leases in the\nconsumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from\ndealers for personal and commercial use. Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used\nvehicles and finance leases (comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases) for new vehicles to retail and\ncommercial customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.\nFinance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers. Ford Credit makes\nwholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as\nloans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership\nreal estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs. Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our\naffiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet\ncompanies. Ford Credit also provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees.\nFord Credit does business in the United States and Canada through business centers. Outside of the United States,\nEurope is Ford Credit\u2019s largest operation. Ford Credit\u2019s European operations are managed primarily through its United\nKingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (\u201cFCE\u201d). Within Europe, Ford Credit\u2019s largest markets are the United Kingdom\nand Germany.\nSee Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit\u2019s\nreceivables, credit losses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies.\nSee Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks.\nWe routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers\u2019 customers who choose to finance or\nlease our vehicles from Ford Credit. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered\nto the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail\nfinance or lease contract with the dealer\u2019s customer. These programs increase Ford Credit\u2019s financing volume and\nshare. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs.\nWe have a Second Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford\nCredit\u2019s managed leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 11.5:1 (as reported in its most recent periodic\nreport), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to\nhave caused such managed leverage to have been 11.5:1. No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this\nagreement. In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCE\u2019s net worth in excess of\n$500 million. No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.\nFord Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit.

In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent\nstandards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most\nsignificant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below:\nVehicle Emissions Control\nU.S. Requirements - Federal and California Tailpipe Emission Standards. Both the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and the California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative\nemissions standards that become increasingly stringent over time. Fifteen states have adopted California\u2019s light-duty\nstandards, other states may join them, and states may also adopt California\u2019s heavy-duty standards. Both federal and\nCalifornia regulations also require motor vehicles to be equipped with on-board diagnostic (\u201cOBD\u201d) systems that monitor\nemission-related systems and components. In addition, light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines must be\ncertified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant states. Canada\naccepts EPA certification. Compliance with emissions standards, OBD requirements, and related regulations can be\nchallenging and can drive increased product development costs, warranty costs, and vehicle recalls.\nCARB has adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 heavy-duty engines, as well as\nextended heavy-duty warranty requirements for the 2022 model year, and EPA has announced that it intends to adopt\nmore stringent heavy-duty standards beginning with the 2027 model year. These rules include more stringent emissions\nstandards, as well as new requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD. CARB has also proposed new\nlight-duty emissions standards applicable to 2026 model year vehicles that include a more stringent fleet-average\nemissions standard and other new emissions requirements. These new rules are expected to impose increased\nchallenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.\nCompliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and\nconsistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use. Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments\nrelated to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers\u2019 warranty costs as well as\ntheir ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards.\n7\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1111 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Business (Continued)\nThe California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for\nsale zero-emission vehicles (\u201cZEVs\u201d). The current light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on\ncredits that can be banked and carried forward, mandates substantial annual increases in the production and sale of\nbattery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles through the 2025 model year. At that time, the regulation will require\ncredits equating to 22% of a manufacturer\u2019s California light-duty vehicle sales volume. California is in the process of\nadopting new ZEV regulations applicable to model years 2026-2035. The proposed regulations include substantial annual\nincreases in required sales volumes, significant restrictions on credit usage, and new requirements for EV battery\ndurability. California has also instituted ZEV regulations aimed at medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the\n2024 model year. These medium- and heavy-duty rules, which could entail significant costs and compliance challenges,\ninclude complex warranty and recall requirements for some vehicle configurations. Compliance with ZEV rules depends\non market conditions as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.\nEuropean Requirements. European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the\namount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United\nKingdom. Regulatory stringency has increased significantly since Stage VI emission standards were introduced, with the\nsubsequent implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission\n2\ntesting using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or \u201cRDE\u201d). These on-road emission tests are in addition\nto the laboratory-based tests. The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the\nallowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase. In addition,\nnew requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation. The costs\nassociated with complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission\u2019s indication of\nits intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication \u201cEU Green Deal\u201d as well as the EU sustainable mobility\naction plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom. In addition, the Whole\nVehicle Type Approval (\u201cWVTA\u201d) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance.\nMoreover, following the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our\nEuropean markets, which could increase vehicle complexity and duties.\nThere is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles, particularly in\nEuropean cities that do not meet air quality limits. The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities\nbased on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities. The speed\nof implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase,\nand there is a risk that these rules may result in the need for customers to retrofit their vehicles with emission after-\ntreatment systems. In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO taxes,\n2\nwhere such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be\nregistered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030.\nOther National Requirements. Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are\nadopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\u201cUN-ECE\u201d) mobile source\nemission regulations. Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of\nEuropean or U.S. regulations. For example, the China Stage VI light duty vehicle emission standards, based on\nEuropean Stage VI emission standards for light duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and\nCARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions. Under the level one (VI(a))\nstandard, which is currently in place nationwide in China, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits,\nexcept for CO, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit. The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard\u2019s emissions\nlimits are approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutant. While level two (VI(b)) is\nnot slated for nationwide implementation until July 2023, the government has encouraged the more economically\ndeveloped cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation. For example, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province, and\nGuangdong province have all begun implementing level two (VI(b)). Both China Stage VII light duty vehicle and heavy\nduty vehicle emission regulations are currently under evaluation, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has\nadvised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for\ngreenhouse gas (primarily CO ) tailpipe emissions.\n2\nCanadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements; however, the existing ZEV\nregulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in\nCalifornia. The federal government has started preliminary consultations on a potential ZEV mandate.\nElsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards. Not all countries have\nadopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted. This could lead to\ncompliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.\n8\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1122 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

In recent years, EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of \u201cdefeat devices.\u201d\nDefeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control\nsystem to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without\njustification. They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.\nRegulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers\u2019 emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat\ndevice settlements by various manufacturers. EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle\ncertification program. CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have\nresulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles. In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard\nemission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of\nmanufacturers for possible defeat devices. Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019\nattorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which\ncould, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.\nVehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards\nU.S. Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles. Federal law requires that light duty vehicles meet minimum corporate\naverage fuel economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d).\nManufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after\ntaking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding\nmodel years. The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each\nmanufacturer\u2019s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.\nEPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions under the Clean Air Act. Because the vast majority of\nGHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy\nstandards. Thus, NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to\navoid potential inconsistencies.\nBeginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy\nregulations under what came to be known as the \u201cOne National Program\u201d (\u201cONP\u201d) framework. California, which had\npromulgated its own state-specific set of GHG regulations, agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy\ncompliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG\nstandards. ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent year-over-year standards.\nONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year. In 2020, EPA introduced significantly less\nstringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 2021-2026. The federal government also revoked\nCalifornia\u2019s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that opted\nin to California\u2019s standards. California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs, challenged in court the\nfederal government\u2019s preemption actions, withdrew from ONP, and planned to return to enforcing its own state-specific\nGHG standards.\nThe litigation over both standards and preemption, with uncertain outcomes, created difficulty for purposes of Ford\u2019s\nfuture product planning. To avoid a \u201cbifurcated\u201d regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that\nadopted California\u2019s GHG standards enforce one set of rules, while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the\ncountry, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford\ncommitted to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program. This\nframework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis, while being consistent with Ford\u2019s\nenvironmental goals. Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020, and other states that adopted the California\nstandards indicated they would respect the agreement.\n9\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1133 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Business (Continued)\nIn 2021, EPA again re-evaluated the stringency of fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year\nand whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels, or greater. Final GHG standards applicable to model\nyears 2023-2026 were finalized in December 2021, with increased stringency. These standards, along with more\nstringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026 that are expected to be finalized in 2022, could increase\ncosts and complexity for Ford. The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking\nCalifornia\u2019s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that\nadopted California\u2019s standards. EPA is expected to take similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act. If any\nfederal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market\nconditions, Ford would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales\nvolumes and results of operations. Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular\noptions; increasing market support programs for Ford\u2019s most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production\nand sale of certain vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks in order to maintain\ncompliance.\nU.S. Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles. EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy\nstandards for heavy-duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating) through the 2027\nmodel year. In Ford\u2019s case, the standards primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles\nsuch as shuttle buses and delivery trucks. As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more\ndifficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.\nEuropean Requirements. The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO emissions\n2\nusing sliding scales with different CO targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for\n2\nits fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial\nvehicles. A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO targets. Pooling agreements\n2\nbetween manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling\nagreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers\nto benefit from our positive CO performance. For \u201cmulti-stage vehicles\u201d (e.g., Ford\u2019s Transit chassis cabs), the base\n2\nmanufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO performance of the final up-fitted vehicles. The initial target\n2\nlevels get significantly more stringent every five years (2025, 2030, 2035), requiring significant investments in propulsion\ntechnologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO emissions. Delayed launches, supply shortages, or lower\n2\ndemand for low CO emission vehicles, as well as a limited charging infrastructure, can trigger compliance risks.\n2\nThe EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and\n2\nheavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges. As discussed\nabove, the EU Commission has announced a \u201cGreen Deal\u201d that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO\n2\nemissions (including stricter CO fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance\n2\nrestrictions. While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target (a\n55% instead of 40% CO reduction compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim\n2\ntargets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.\nOutside of the EU, the United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules. Ford faces the risk of advance\npremium payment requirements for both passenger cars as well as for light commercial vehicles due to, for example,\nunexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.\nThe United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO . This world light duty test\n2\nprocedure (\u201cWLTP\u201d) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO and fuel consumption figures with customer-\n2\nreported figures. The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO labeling,\n2\nthereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO tax scheme as well as CO fleet regulations for passenger cars and light\n2 2\ncommercial vehicles. Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.\nSome European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO vehicle emissions,\n2\nincluding fiscal measures and CO labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord. For\n2\nexample, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced\ntaxation based on CO emissions. The EU CO requirements are likely to trigger further measures.\n2 2\n10\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1144 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the\nCanadian Environmental Protection Act. In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes\nto the regulation for light-duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025\nmodel years. The revised U.S. EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 2022-2025\nmodel years; however, Canada also undertook a mid-term evaluation of the standards for the 2022 model year and\nbeyond, which concluded in 2021 and sought to align with the most stringent standards in the United States (federal or\nstate). When U.S. EPA\u2019s final rule goes into effect, Canada will automatically adopt the new standards by reference to the\nU.S. Code of Federal Regulations. However, consultation is now underway for the few standalone elements that are not\nautomatically adopted by reference for the 2023-2025 model years, and these draft amendments are expected in 2022.\nThe heavy-duty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond were published in\nMay 2018 and are in line with U.S. requirements, subject to any change in those requirements under the current U.S.\npresidential administration.\nChina\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle (\u201cNEV\u201d) Credit Administrative Rules contain\nfuel consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles, i.e., plug-in hybrids, battery\nelectric vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles. The fuel consumption requirement uses a weight-based approach to establish\ntargets, with year-over-year target reductions. China set a target of 5.0L/100km for the 2020 passenger vehicle industry\nfuel consumption fleet average, which lowers to 4.0L/100km by 2025 based on the New European Driving Cycle (\u201cNEDC\u201d)\nsystem. The government is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction in 2030 and is targeting 3.2L/100km. The\nNEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year, with NEV credits of at least 14%,\n16%, and 18% of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volume required in 2021, 2022, and 2023,\nrespectively. Future percentages are currently under consideration.\nAs discussed below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply\nwith safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous vehicle, and other regulations,\u201d a production disruption, stop ship,\nlower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product\nplans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with fuel economy standards.\nVehicle Safety\nU.S. Requirements. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the \u201cSafety Act\u201d) regulates vehicles\nand vehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle\nor equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding\nmany safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance and public domain (e.g., New Car\nAssessment Programs (\u201cNCAPs\u201d), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (\u201cIIHS\u201d)) requirements continue to evolve, are\nincreasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally. As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous\nvehicles and broader mobility products and services, our financial exposure has increased. Second, the Safety Act\nrequires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is\nobligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA\ndetermine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such\nrecall campaigns could be substantial.\nEuropean Requirements. The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt\nadditional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-vehicle data and\nautonomous vehicles.\nThe European General Safety Regulation (\u201cGSR\u201d) introduced UN-ECE regulations, which will be required for the\nEuropean Type Approval process. The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety\nfeatures, including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models in 2022 and for all registrations in 2024. EU\nregulators also are focusing on active safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control,\nand automatic brake assist.\nOther National Requirements. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with\nminor variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can\nadd complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize\nregulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; several on-going\nbilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal.\n11\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1155 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Business (Continued)\nSafety and recall requirements in Brazil, China, India, and Gulf Cooperation Council (\u201cGCC\u201d) countries may add\nsubstantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice. Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets, and penalties\nare applied, if these levels are not maintained, while a tax reduction may be available for over-performance. In Canada,\nregulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety\nAct, the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance\nwhen the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. In 2021, Canada started preliminary consultations on several\nnew proposed regulations, including an Administrative Monetary Penalties (\u201cAMPs\u201d) Regulation. Draft language for the\nAMPs regulation is expected in 2022. In China, a new mandatory Event Data Recorder regulation that is more\ncomprehensive than U.S. requirements has been released, and in China, Malaysia, and South Korea, mandatory e-Call\nrequirements are being drafted. E-Call is mandatory in the UAE for new vehicles beginning with the 2021 model year, and\nis expected to become mandatory in a number of other GCC countries within five years.\nNew Car Assessment Programs. Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to\nprovide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests\nand other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle\nsafety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which may vary\nby country or region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles. Similarly, environmental rating systems exist in various\nregions, e.g., Green NCAP in Europe. In China, C-NCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number of five-\nstar ratings. Further, the China Insurance Auto Safety Index (similar to IIHS) has been implemented, with higher\nstandards for passenger and pedestrian protection and driver assistance technologies. These protocols impose additional\nrequirements relating to testing, evaluation, and mandatory safety features, and compliance with them (or any subsequent\nupdates to them) may be costly.\n12\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1166 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

We are committed to creating an environment where employees and\nPeople Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford+.\nEmployee Sentiment Strategy\nWe leverage our ask/listen/observe framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford. This approach is a holistic\nand consistent methodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly.\nOur measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business: Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing,\nHealth & Safety (including our COVID-19 safety protocols), Employee Experience, Culture, DEI, Leadership, and Strategic\nAlignment. Our efforts to drive change in these areas are paying off. For example, we began surveying our employees\nabout their work-life balance at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; in 2021, 87% of the respondents, which were\nprimarily salaried employees, indicated that they have the flexibility to balance the needs of their work and personal lives.\nIn 2021, employee responses also indicated that 84% of respondents understand corporate strategy and their role in it,\nand 85% are excited about what Ford can accomplish in the future.\nA critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best\npositioned to drive meaningful change. To this end, leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their\nteams and organizations, as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools. Our\nmeasurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of\ntalent initiatives across the enterprise.\nEmployment Data\nThe approximate number of individuals employed by us and entities that we consolidated as of December 31 was as\nfollows (in thousands):\n2020 (a) 2021\nNorth America 100 99\nSouth America 8 4\nEurope 42 42\nChina (including Taiwan) 4 3\nInternational Markets Group 14 16\nTotal Automotive 168 164\nFord Credit 6 5\nMobility 2 2\nCorporate and Other 10 12\nTotal Company 186 183\n__________\n(a) Effective with 2021 reporting, certain costs for the benefit of the global enterprise previously reported in Automotive are now reported in Corporate\nOther, and costs and benefits related to connectivity previously reported in Mobility are now reported in Automotive. Prior period totals have been\nupdated to be consistent with 2021 reporting.\nThe reduction in employees in 2021 is primarily a result of our global redesign efforts, primarily in South America and\nEurope, partially offset by the addition of employees in growth areas, including software and electrification.\n15\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 1199 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Risk Factors.\nWe have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories: Operational\nRisks; Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks; Financial Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks.\nOperational Risks\nFord and Ford Credit\u2019s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be\nadversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19. We face various\nrisks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of\nCOVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns,\nand restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy.\nThere have been extraordinary actions taken by international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental\nauthorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions throughout the world, including travel\nbans, quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities\nand for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. For example, in 2020, consistent with the actions taken\nby governmental authorities, we idled our manufacturing operations in regions around the world before ultimately\nresuming our manufacturing operations taking a phased approach and after introducing new safety protocols at our plants.\nTo the extent cases surge in any locations, stringent limitations on daily activities that may have been eased previously\ncould be reinstated in those areas. Further, if new strains or variants of COVID-19 develop or sufficient amounts of\nvaccines or treatments are not available, not widely administered for a significant period of time, or otherwise prove\nineffective, the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, and, in turn, our financial condition, liquidity, and results of\noperations could be material.\nThe predominant share of Ford Credit\u2019s business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles, and the duration or\nresurgence of COVID-19 or similar public health issues may negatively impact the level of originations at Ford Credit. For\nexample, Ford\u2019s suspension of manufacturing operations, a significant decline in dealer showroom traffic, and/or a\nreduction of operations at dealers may lead to a significant decline in Ford Credit\u2019s consumer and non-consumer\noriginations. Moreover, COVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on many businesses and unemployment rates\nincreased from pre-COVID-19 levels. Economic uncertainty and higher unemployment may result in higher defaults in\nFord Credit\u2019s consumer portfolio, and prolonged unemployment may have a negative impact on both new and used\nvehicle demand.\nThe global economic slowdown and stay-at-home orders enacted across the United States disrupted auction activity\nin many locations, which adversely impacted and caused delays in realizing the resale value for off-lease and\nrepossessed vehicles. Although auction values have increased significantly, future or additional restrictions could have a\nsimilar adverse impact on Ford Credit. For more information about the impact of higher credit losses and lower residual\nvalues on Ford Credit\u2019s business, see \u201cFord Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-\nanticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles\u201d below.\nAs described in more detail below under \u201cFord and Ford Credit\u2019s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets\naround the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market\nvolatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors,\u201d the volatility created by COVID-19 adversely\naffected Ford Credit\u2019s access to the debt and securitization markets and its cost of funding, and any volatility in the capital\nmarkets as a result of a surge in cases of COVID-19, new outbreaks or variants, or for any other reason could have an\nadverse impact on Ford Credit\u2019s access to those markets and its cost of funding.\n17\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2211 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 18, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nThe full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on\nfuture developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the outbreak (including any potential future waves, the\nemergence or re-emergence of variants and their transmissibility, and the success of vaccination programs and\ntreatments), its impact on our customers, dealers, and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations, and\nthe demand for our products can resume, and any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause. For\nexample, in the event manufacturing operations are again suspended, fully ramping up our production schedule to prior\nlevels may take longer than the prior resumption and will depend, in part, on whether our suppliers and dealers have\nresumed normal operations. Our automotive operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing\noperations are suspended, but we continue to incur operating and non-operating expenses, resulting in a deterioration of\nour cash flow. Accordingly, any significant future disruption to our production schedule, regionally or globally, whether as a\nresult of our own or a supplier\u2019s suspension of operations, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, liquidity, and results of operations. Further, government-sponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to\nCOVID-19 may not be available to our customers, suppliers, dealers, or us, and if available, may nevertheless be\ninsufficient to address the impacts of COVID-19. Moreover, our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by\nsupplier or dealer bankruptcies or their permanent discontinuation of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K Report, including, but not\nlimited to, our competitiveness, demand or market acceptance for our products and services, and shifting consumer\npreferences, and our ability to successfully execute our strategy.\nFord is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford\u2019s production\nschedule, and a shortage of key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials can disrupt Ford\u2019s\nproduction of vehicles. Our products contain components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source\ncomponents from their suppliers. If there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain, and the component\ncannot be easily sourced from a different supplier, the shortage may disrupt our production. For example, the automotive\nindustry continues to face a significant shortage of semiconductors, which has a complex supply chain with long lead\ntimes required to increase production and capacity. The shortage is due in large part to strong cross-industry demand,\nwhich has presented challenges and production disruptions globally, including at our assembly plants. In addition,\nRenesas Electronics Corporation, a key supplier of semiconductors for the automotive industry and for us in particular,\nexperienced a significant fire at its Naka Factory in March 2021, and COVID-related work restrictions in Southeast Asia\nhave further impacted semiconductor production. With up to fifty modules on a vehicle, we and our competitors who need\nintegrated circuits are experiencing various levels of semiconductor impact. A shortage of key components or raw\nmaterials as a result of disruptions in the supply chain, capacity constraints, competition for those items within the\nautomotive industry and other sectors, or otherwise can cause a significant disruption to our production schedule and\nhave a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFord\u2019s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+. We previously announced\nour plan for growth and value creation \u2013 Ford+. Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric\nproducts plus \u201cAlways-On\u201d customer relationships and user experiences. Our Ford+ plan is designed to leverage our\nfoundational strengths to build new capabilities \u2013 enriching customer experiences and deepening loyalty. As we\nundertake this transformation of our business, we must integrate our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business model,\nand balance competing priorities, or we will not be successful. To facilitate this transformation, we are making substantial\ninvestments, recruiting new talent, and optimizing our business model, management system, and organization.\nAccordingly, maintaining discipline in our capital allocation continues to be important, as a strong core business and a\nbalance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in these new growth opportunities is critical to the success of our Ford+\nplan. If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles, services, technology, and other calls on capital,\nor we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford+ (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control), we may not be\nable to realize the full benefits of our plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Furthermore, if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect, it may lead to an\nincrease in shareholder activism, which may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management\u2019s attention and\nresources.\n18\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2222 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 19, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord\u2019s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or\nincreased warranty costs. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle\nsafety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles\ndo not comply with a safety standard. NHTSA\u2019s enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being\nlevied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers\u2019 safety processes, a\ntrend that could continue. Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a\nnoncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle\ncould be delayed until such defect is remedied. The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in\nvehicles that have been sold could be substantial, particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects\nthat are identified years after production. For example, NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a\nstudy of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States. Of these,\napproximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles. Should NHTSA determine that the inflators\ncontain a safety defect, Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs. Further,\nto the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers, our ability\nto recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers\u2019 financial condition. We accrue the estimated cost of both\nbase warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold, and we reevaluate the adequacy of our\naccruals on a regular basis. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated\ncost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. For additional information regarding warranty and field service action\ncosts, including our process for establishing our reserves, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Item 7 and Note 25 of the\nNotes to the Financial Statements. If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and\ncomponent complexity, the adoption of new technologies, or otherwise, such costs could have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, launch delays, recall actions, and increased warranty costs could\nadversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed below under \u201cFord\u2019s new and existing\nproducts, digital and physical services, and mobility services are subject to market acceptance and face significant\ncompetition from existing and new entrants in the automotive, mobility, and digital services industries.\u201d\nFord may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures,\nacquisitions, divestitures, or new business strategies. We have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and\nannounced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter into\nsimilar relationships with additional companies. These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity and may involve a\nlengthy regulatory approval process. As a result, we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated\nbenefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed. For example, we may not successfully\nintegrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems,\nprocedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence\nprior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the\nother party. Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our\nability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our\ncompliance or internal control systems. In addition, implementation of a new business strategy may lead to the disruption\nof our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations. Results of operations from\nnew activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our\ninvestments, which may be significant, in that strategy. Moreover, we may continue to have financial exposure following a\nstrategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market, and restructuring actions may subject us to potential claims\nfrom employees, suppliers, dealers, or governmental authorities or harm our reputation. Failure to successfully and timely\nrealize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition\nor results of operations.\n19\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2233 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 20, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nOperational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents,\nransomware attacks, and other disruptions. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-\nvehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store electronic\ninformation that is important to the operation of our business, our vehicles, and the services we offer. Despite security\nmeasures, we are at risk for interruptions, outages, and compromises of: (i) operational systems (including business,\nfinancial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii)\nfacility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber\nattack, security breach, or other reasons, e.g., a natural disaster, fire, or overburdened infrastructure system. Such\nincidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively\nsensitive information; compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or others; jeopardize the\nsecurity of our facilities; affect the performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our\nvehicles. This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity. Moreover,\nwe, our suppliers, and our dealers have been the target of cyber attacks in the past, and such attacks will continue and\nevolve in the future, which may cause cyber incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time. Our networks and\nin-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be impacted by, or a data breach may result from, the\nnegligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and systems. We continually\nemploy capabilities, processes, and other security measures designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks;\nhowever, such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or\nmitigate all potential risks. Moreover, a cyber incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our\nsecurity measures, and/or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, and a cyber incident involving us or one of our\nsuppliers could impact production, our internal operations, or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.\nFord\u2019s production, as well as Ford\u2019s suppliers\u2019 production, could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or\nman-made disasters, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors. A work\nstoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford\u2019s or its suppliers\u2019 facilities for any number of reasons,\nincluding as a result of labor issues, including disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions\nor in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, absenteeism, public health issues (e.g.,\nCOVID-19), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions (e.g., plant closures); as a result of\nsupplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of components, including but not\nlimited to semiconductors, or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other difficulties; as a result of a natural\ndisaster (including climate-related physical risk); cyber incidents; or for other reasons. Many components used in our\nvehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore, cannot be re-sourced quickly or\ninexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another\nsupplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.). Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt\nour production as leverage in negotiations. In addition, when we undertake a model changeover, significant downtime at\none or more of our production facilities may be required, and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we\nexperience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier\u2019s facility. Moreover, as vehicles, components, and\ntheir integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles.\nRegardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited. Accordingly, a significant disruption\nto our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and\nmay impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under \u201cFord may need to\nsubstantially modify its product plans to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous vehicle, and other\nregulations.\u201d\nFord\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints.\nSubstantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States and Canada are represented\nby unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit\nlevels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security, subject to certain conditions. These agreements\nmay restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses. A substantial number of our employees in other regions are\nrepresented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other\nemployment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or\nother facilities.\n20\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2244 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 21, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord\u2019s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and\ncompetitiveness. Our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees\nwho are highly skilled in engineering, software, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), marketing, and\nfinance, among other areas. Competition for such employees is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation\nthroughout the labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for employers. In addition to compensation\nconsiderations, potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for\ncompanies with a clear purpose, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations. If we are not perceived as an\nemployer of choice, we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees. Further, if we lose existing employees with\nneeded skills or we are unable to upskill and develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new\ntechnologies, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.\nMacroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks\nFord\u2019s new and existing products, digital and physical services, and mobility services are subject to market\nacceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive, mobility, and\ndigital services industries. Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles\nand introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing\nproducts and services in the marketplace, and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or the\nsuccess of new products or services in the market. It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an\nexisting vehicle. Because customers\u2019 preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate\nsales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs. Offering vehicles and\nservices that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but\nproducts and services that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall\nvalue, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. For example, if we are unable to differentiate our\nproducts and services from those of our competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor\nour products and services to customers in other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and\nservices, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWith increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations\nrelating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our\nreputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or\nunfounded. Further, our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of\nelectrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and mobility depends on many factors, including advancements\nin technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging network), and other\nfactors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles, digital and\nphysical services, and mobility services. The automotive, mobility, and digital service businesses are very competitive and\nare undergoing rapid changes. Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of competitors\n(particularly in our areas of strength, e.g., pick-up trucks and utilities) that may possess superior technology, may have\nbusiness models with certain aspects that are more efficient, and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us,\nare entering the market. This level of competition increases the importance of our ability to anticipate, develop, and\ndeliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line with demand, and at costs low\nenough to be profitable.\nWe have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and mobility. Our\nplans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit. If the\nmarket for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a\nrapid adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, or\nif consumers prefer our competitors\u2019 vehicles, there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Further, as discussed below under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with\nsafety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous vehicle, and other regulations,\u201d lower than planned market acceptance of\nour vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards. Moreover, new offerings, including those\nrelated to electric and autonomous vehicles, may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and\novercome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated. In addition, since new\ntechnologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any manufacturer\u2019s autonomous vehicle may\nnegatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust.\n21\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK__RR22..iinndddd 2255 22//1177//2222 33::3377 PPMM"}

Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord\u2019s near-term results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United\nStates. A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines\n(including trucks and utilities) to battery electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in\nan adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the near term. In the longer term, if demand for\nbattery electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles,\nlower market share and revenue, as well as facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation)\nassociated with the production of internal combustion vehicles, may result.\nWith a global footprint, Ford\u2019s results could be adversely affected by economic, geopolitical, protectionist\ntrade policies, or other events, including tariffs. With the interconnectedness of the global economy, the challenges of\na pandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, geopolitical crisis, or other significant\nevent in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world.\nChanges in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Steps taken by the U.S. government to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other\nproducts and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, and\nmay lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for\ncustomers in other markets, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive. China presents unique risks to U.S.\nautomakers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations and China\u2019s unique regulatory landscape.\nWe have operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments. This may expose us to\nheightened risks of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our\nmanufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result\nof systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities, and acts of terrorism, each of which\ncould have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, the U.S. government,\nother governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions that could restrict us from doing\nbusiness directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.\nIndustry sales volume in any of Ford\u2019s key markets can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial\ncrisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event. Because we, like other manufacturers, have a high proportion of\nrelatively fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash\nflow and results of operations. Industry vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions and\ndeveloping trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the transportation as a service model, e.g., ridesharing services.\nIf industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption for key markets including the\nUnited States, Europe, or China, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flow. For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.\nFord may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry\nexcess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors. The global automotive industry is\nintensely competitive, with manufacturing capacity generally far exceeding current demand (the recent capacity\nconstraints being a temporary exception). Historically, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering\nmarketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have\nincluded a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives. As a result, we\nare not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs,\nor the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, including cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their\nweaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices. As\nthe automotive industry transitions to battery electric vehicles, excess capacity, particularly for internal combustion engine\ntrucks and utilities, may continue or increase. This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that\nsegment of the market, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n22\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2266 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Risk Factors (Continued)\nInflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand market value of Ford or Ford Credit\u2019s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant\neffect on results. We are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes\nin commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as\nan integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to\nreduce potentially adverse effects on our business. Changes in commodity prices (from tariffs, as discussed above under\n\u201cWith a global footprint, Ford\u2019s results could be adversely affected by economic, geopolitical, protectionist trade policies, or\nother events, including tariffs,\u201d or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted,\nhedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility. As a result, significant changes in commodity prices,\nforeign currency exchange rates, or interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or\nresults of operations. See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity price, and interest rate\nrisks. In addition, our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments, including our Rivian\nmarketable securities, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.\nFinancial Risks\nFord and Ford Credit\u2019s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive\nrates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption,\nregulatory requirements, or other factors. Ford and Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable\ncost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness. Further, Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain\nsecuritized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization\ntransactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit\u2019s ability\nto obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk. Over\ntime, and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford\nCredit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints. The\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR is one such risk that could cause market volatility or disruption and could adversely affect Ford\nCredit\u2019s access to the debt, securitization, or derivative markets and increase its cost of funding and hedging. In addition,\nFord Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand\nfor the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated\nwith its securitization transactions. A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or\noriginates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the\nsale of Ford vehicles.\nFord\u2019s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback. We receive\neconomic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives\ndesigned to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production. These\nincentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits. The impact of these\nincentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of,\nor other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative\ndecision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Until\n2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments\nhistorically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing\nproduction, and create jobs. As a result, the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably\nby government incentives to a substantial extent. The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us\nconcerning the federal incentives we previously received, and the State of S\u00e3o Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax\nincentives by the State of Bahia. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for\ngovernment incentives, and \u201cItem 3.

{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 24, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or\nhigher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles. Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer\u2019s or\ndealer\u2019s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic\nfactors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car\nprices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit\u2019s business. The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could\nexceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. In addition, Ford Credit\nprojects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the\nvehicles it leases. Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination\nmay be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce Ford Credit\u2019s return on the lease transaction. Among the\nfactors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industry-wide,\neconomic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the\nvehicles, or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes. Actual return volumes may be influenced\nby these factors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values. In 2021, Ford Credit experienced\nlower-than-expected return volumes. If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed\nFord Credit\u2019s expectations. Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford\nCredit\u2019s results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit\u2019s projections. See \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d in Item 7 for additional discussion.\nEconomic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement benefit plans (e.g., discount\nrates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed. The measurement of our obligations, costs,\nand liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans requires that we\nestimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants. We use many assumptions in calculating\nthese estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and\ndemographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates). We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end\nand recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred. To the\nextent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may recognize a remeasurement loss in our results,\nwhich could be substantial. For additional information regarding our assumptions, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in\nItem 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nPension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford\u2019s liquidity and financial condition.\nWe have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees. We\nalso provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe. In addition, we sponsor plans to\nprovide other postretirement benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans. These benefit plans\nimpose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our\nliquidity. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be\nforced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or\nrestructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFord and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or\nadverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or\notherwise. We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and\nstationary source emissions regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and other standards, but we\ncannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations. In addition, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety, emissions, fuel\neconomy, autonomous vehicle, and other regulations\u201d and \u201cFord Credit could be subject to new or increased credit\nregulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations,\u201d regulatory standards and interpretations may change\non short notice and impact our compliance status. Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not\nnecessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. In certain circumstances,\ncourts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other\napplicable law. Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our\ncompliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products, services, or business or commercial relationships,\nrequires significant expenditures of time and other resources. Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could\nexperience significant adverse results, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations. In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could\nhave a significant adverse effect on our sales.\n24\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2288 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 25, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy,\nautonomous vehicle, and other regulations. The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern\nproduct characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within national boundaries. Further,\nadditional and new regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment (including\nconcerns about global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory\nlandscape can change on short notice. In the United States, legal and policy debates are continuing, with a primary focus\non reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification. The Trump administration rolled back Obama\nadministration GHG standards through the 2026 model year and sought to block California\u2019s authority to adopt its own\nregulations as well as other states\u2019 authority to opt in to California\u2019s standards. States, environmental groups, and others\nchallenged both of those Trump administration actions in court. The Biden administration has completed actions to\nreverse the rollback of GHG emissions standards and repeal a NHTSA rule blocking California and other states\u2019 authority,\nand the administration is expected to reverse NHTSA\u2019\u2019s rollback of fuel economy standards and EPA\u2019s action blocking\nCalifornia and other states\u2019 authority. California has an ambitious plan to reduce overall GHG emissions to 40% below\n1990 levels by 2030 and EPA is also developing new and more stringent GHG emissions standards after the 2026 model\nyear. Court rulings and actions by federal, California, and other state regulators create regulatory uncertainty and the\npotential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly. In addition, many governments regulate local product\ncontent and/or impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing\nthe balance of payments.\nWe are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum-powered\nvehicles and to offer more propulsion choices, such as electrified vehicles, with lower GHG emissions. There are limits on\nour ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, however, primarily relating to the cost and\neffectiveness of available technologies, consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix (as\ndescribed in more detail above under \u201cFord\u2019s new and existing products, digital and physical services, and mobility\nservices are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the\nautomotive, mobility, and digital services industries\u201d), willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new\ntechnologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread\navailability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, and the human, engineering, and financial\nresources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. If fuel\nprices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-\nefficient vehicles in large numbers, it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards without compromising\nresults. Moreover, a production disruption, stop ship, limited availability of necessary components, e.g., batteries, lower\nthan planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans,\nor, in some cases, purchase credits, in order to comply with fuel economy standards, which could have an adverse effect\non our financial condition or results of operations and/or cause reputational harm.\nIncreased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more\nstringent enforcement programs, requests for field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions\ncomponents and higher scrutiny of field data, and/or delays in regulatory approvals. The cost to comply with existing\ngovernment regulations (in addition to the cost of any field service actions that may result from regulatory actions) is\nsubstantial and additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or changes in consumer preferences that\naffect vehicle mix could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition,\na number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.\nThe protocols could change, and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such\ntests could reduce future sales. Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto\nchanges in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations, thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers.\nFor more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business, see the \u201cGovernmental Standards\u201d discussion in\n\u201cItem 1. Business\u201d above.\nWe and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies, and the U.S. and foreign\ngovernments are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles. The evolution of\nthe regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles, and the pace of the development of such regulatory framework, may\nsubject us to increased costs and uncertainty, and may ultimately impact our ability to deliver autonomous vehicles and\nrelated services that customers want.\n25\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 2299 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal\ninformation, are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from\nstate to state or country to country. Accordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in\nconsumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices. Moreover,\nregulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance and/or legal actions (including\npursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a data\ncompromise, misuse of consumer information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection or privacy\nrequirements.

Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on,\nor otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business. The CFPB has authority to supervise and\nexamine the largest nonbank automotive finance companies, such as Ford Credit, for compliance with consumer financial\nprotection laws.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions,\nincluding consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise practices, remunerate customers,\nor pay fines. An enforcement action against Ford Credit could harm Ford Credit\u2019s reputation or lead to further litigation.\nITEM 1B.

Legal Proceedings.\nThe litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with\nassurance. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of loss contingencies. Following is a\ndiscussion of our significant pending legal proceedings:\nPRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS\nWe are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging\ndamages from injuries resulting from (or aggravated by) alleged defects in our vehicles. In many actions, no monetary\namount of damages is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum. Our experience with\nlitigation alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts, on average, bear little relation to the actual\namount of damages, if any, that we will pay in resolving such matters.\nIn addition to pending actions, we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported\nto us. We also take into consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to\nlitigation. Individual product liability matters that have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be\nsignificant if the matter is resolved unfavorably to us would be described herein. Currently there are no such matters to\nreport.\nASBESTOS MATTERS\nAsbestos was used in some brakes, clutches, and other automotive components from the early 1900s. Along with\nother vehicle manufacturers, we have been the target of asbestos litigation and, as a result, are a defendant in various\nactions for injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos.\nPlaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure, either from\ncomponent parts found in older vehicles, insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities, or asbestos aboard our\nformer maritime fleet. We believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many previously\ntargeted companies have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims.\n28\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 3322 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Legal Proceedings (Continued)\nMost of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles.\nWe are prepared to defend these cases and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long-standing position that\nthere is no increased risk of asbestos-related disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the\nbrakes on our vehicles. The extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and\ncould include both compensatory and punitive damage awards. The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar\namount for damages; in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum, and the vast\nmajority of these cases involve multiple defendants, sometimes more than one hundred. Many of these cases also\ninvolve multiple plaintiffs, and often we are unable to tell from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us\n(as opposed to other defendants). Annual payout and defense costs may become significant in the future. Our accrual for\nasbestos matters includes probable losses for both asserted and unasserted claims.\nCONSUMER MATTERS\nWe provide warranties on the vehicles we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage and\nvary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will\nrepair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the\nspecified warranty period. We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging breach of warranty\nand claiming damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws. Remedies under these statutes may include\nvehicle repurchase, civil penalties, and payment by Ford of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. In some cases, plaintiffs also\ninclude an allegation of fraud. Remedies for a fraud claim may include contract rescission, vehicle repurchase, and\npunitive damages.\nThe cost of these litigation matters is included in our warranty costs. We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the\ntime of sale using a patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and\naverage cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.

We also may have\nbeen a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites. The amount of any such costs or damages for\nwhich we may be held responsible could be significant. At this time, we have no legal proceedings arising under any\nfederal, state, or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the\nenvironment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, in which (i) a governmental authority is a party,\nand (ii) we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) in excess of $1,000,000.\nCLASS ACTIONS\nIn light of the fact that few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have been certified by the courts\nas class actions, in general we list those actions that (i) have been certified as a class action by a court of competent\njurisdiction (and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and\ncertified class), and (ii) have more than a remote risk of loss, and such loss would likely be significant if the action is\nresolved unfavorably to us.

One Brazilian state (S\u00e3o Paulo) and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have\noutstanding substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda. (\u201cFord Brazil\u201d) related to state and\nfederal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The S\u00e3o Paulo assessment is\npart of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil. The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the\nstates to end that conflict, and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution. Ford Brazil\ncontinues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the\nstates to be resolved under that framework. The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation.\nAll of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction. To\nproceed with an appeal within the judicial court system, an appellant may be required to post collateral. To date, we have\nnot been required to post any collateral. If we are required to post collateral, which could be in excess of $1 billion, we\nexpect it to be in the form of fixed assets, surety bonds, and/or letters of credit, but we may be required to post cash\ncollateral. Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years, we consider our overall risk of loss to\nbe remote.\nEuropean Competition Law Matter. On October 5, 2018, FCE Bank plc (\u201cFCE\u201d) received a notice from the Italian\nCompetition Authority (the \u201cICA\u201d) concerning an alleged violation of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union. The ICA alleged that FCE and other parties engaged in anti-competitive practices in relation to the\nautomotive finance market in Italy. On January 9, 2019, FCE received a decision from the ICA, which included an\nassessment of a fine against FCE in the amount of \u20ac42 million. On March 8, 2019, FCE appealed the decision and the\nfine to the Italian administrative court, and on November 24, 2020, the Italian administrative court ruled in favor of FCE.\nOn December 23, 2020, the ICA filed an appeal of the Italian administrative court\u2019s decision to the Italian Council of State,\nand a hearing on the appeal was held on January 13, 2022. On February 1, 2022, the Italian Council of State dismissed\nthe ICA\u2019s appeal.\nEmissions Certification. Beginning in 2018 and continuing into 2020, the Company investigated a potential concern\ninvolving its U.S. emissions certification process. The matter focused on issues related to road load estimations, including\nanalytical modeling and coastdown testing. The potential concern did not involve the use of defeat devices (see Item 1,\nGovernmental Standards for a definition of defeat devices). We voluntarily disclosed this matter to the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and the California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) on February 18, 2019 and\nFebruary 21, 2019, respectively. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) opened a criminal investigation\ninto the matter. In addition, we notified a number of other state and federal agencies. We cooperated fully with these\ngovernment agencies. We received notifications from EPA, CARB, and DOJ that these agencies have closed their\ninquiries into the matter and do not intend to take any further action. Environment and Climate Change Canada\u2019s request\nfor information has been completed.\nTransit Connect Customs Penalty Notice. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) ruled in 2013 that Transit\nConnects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25% duty applicable to\ncargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% duty applicable to passenger vehicles. We filed a challenge in the U.S. Court of\nInternational Trade (\u201cCIT\u201d), and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017. CBP subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled in favor of CBP. Following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s denial of our\npetition for a writ of certiorari in 2020, we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports, plus interest, and disclosed\nthat CBP might assert a claim for penalties. Subsequently, CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22, 2021, and on\nNovember 18, 2021, CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of $1.3 billion and additional duties of $181 million,\nplus interest. We intend to vigorously defend our actions and contest payment of the penalty and the additional duties.\nITEM 4.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\nSupplier Disruptions. The automotive industry has a complex supply network with each manufacturers\u2019 products\ncontaining components sourced from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their suppliers. When there is a\nshortage of a key component in our supply chain, and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier,\nthe shortage can disrupt production. Since early 2021, we and others in the automotive industry have faced a significant\nshortage of semiconductors. The global semiconductor shortage is due in large part to makers of semiconductors having\nallocated their capacity to meet surging demand for consumer electronics during the COVID-19 pandemic while\nautomotive OEMs experienced industry-wide plant closures. At the same time, wafer foundries that support chipmakers\nhave not invested enough in recent years to increase capacities to the levels needed to support demand from all of their\ncustomers. Wafers have a long lead time for production, which further exacerbates the shortage. When global\nautomakers resumed vehicle production in 2020 \u2013 even more quickly than some expected \u2013 semiconductor supplies\nbecame further strained. A combination of these factors, including increased demand for consumer electronics,\nautomotive shutdowns due to COVID-19, the rapid recovery of demand for vehicles, and long lead times for wafer\nproduction, is contributing to the ongoing shortage of semiconductors. For additional information on the impact of the\nsemiconductor shortage, see the Outlook section on page 73.\nCOVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market\ndownturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy.\nConsistent with the actions taken by governmental authorities, in late March 2020, we idled our manufacturing operations\nin regions around the world other than China, where manufacturing operations were suspended in January and February\nbefore beginning to resume operations in March. A successful phased restart of our manufacturing plants, supply\nnetwork, and other dependent functions occurred in the second quarter of 2020. The remote work arrangements that we\nimplemented in 2020 remain in place in most locations. Our remote work arrangements have been designed to allow for\ncontinued operation of non-production business-critical functions, including financial reporting systems and internal\ncontrol. The full impact of COVID-19 on future results depends on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and\nscope of outbreaks (including any potential future waves due to variants or otherwise, and the success of vaccination\nprograms) and their impact on our customers, dealers, and suppliers. Despite the successful restart of our manufacturing\noperations in 2020, we continue to experience intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain. Moreover,\nnew restrictions could have an adverse effect on production, supply chains, distribution, and demand for vehicles. For\nadditional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID-19 on us, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors on page\n17.\nGlobal Redesign. We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business, pursuant to which we\nare working to turn around automotive operations, compete like a challenger, and capitalize on our strengths by allocating\nmore capital, more resources, and more talent to our strongest business and vehicle franchises. Pursuant to the plan, we\nexpect to incur about $11 billion of EBIT charges, with about $7 billion of cash effects, related to our global redesign\nefforts. During the 2018 through 2022 period, we expect to have incurred the vast majority of the $11 billion of EBIT\ncharges. For additional information on Global Redesign, see the Outlook section on page 73.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, are poised to withdraw monetary stimulus by\nraising interest rates. The last time the Fed shifted from easing to tightening, from 2013 through 2017, the U.S. dollar\nstrengthened, and financial markets became more volatile. Increased volatility in both developed and emerging market\ncurrencies may again be a result of policy tightening. Emerging markets also face differing inflation backdrops and, in\nsome cases, exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value\nof their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency\nmovements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets, most notably in the case of the Japanese\nyen and Korean won. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different\nmacroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are\nheavily influenced or controlled by governments.\n34\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 3388 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2021", "page": 35, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2021.pdf", "text": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nExcess Capacity. According to IHS Automotive, an automotive research firm, the estimated global production\ncapacity for light vehicles of about 124 million units exceeded global production by just under 41 million units in 2021.\nActual global production is projected to have risen by 8.9 million units in 2021, while capacity rose by just under 2 million\nunits, leading excess capacity to decline by just under 7 million units. Part of the decline was due to the impact of\nCOVID-19-related production disruptions, but the rebound in 2021 production still left global excess capacity 1% above\n2019. In North America, the amount of excess capacity rose from 4.8 million units in 2019 to 7.5 million units in 2020, but\nthen fell to 5.7 million units in 2021. Europe followed a similar pattern, with excess capacity rising from 6.2 million units in\n2019 to 10.6 million in 2020, but then declining to 8.6 million in 2021. In Asia, however, excess capacity declined from\n19.3 million units in 2019 to 15.9 million in 2020 and to 15.2 million units in 2021, coming off a weak base for China\u2019s\neconomy and automotive sector during 2018 and 2019. After the pandemic-related disruptions ease, IHS projects that\nglobal excess capacity will trend lower, from around 49% of capacity in 2021 to just under 30% in 2028. Despite the\nprojected gradual decline, the amount of excess capacity will remain substantial and represents a risk to automotive\nprices and revenue.\nPricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to both\nrising demand and supply shortages. It is likely that the rate of price increases will slow down as auto production slowly\nrecovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic\nlevels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-\nadjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive\nindustry in most major markets.\nCommodity and Energy Price Changes. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has driven energy prices higher\nover the last year. Oil prices are expected to remain volatile, and are likely to rise in the near term because of low global\nstocks. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will\nalso contribute to volatility of oil and other energy prices. Prices for other commodities have also been volatile though\ngenerally higher, as fluctuating global demand and differences in output across sectors due to the pandemic have\ngenerated divergence in price movements across different commodities. For additional information on commodity costs,\nsee the Outlook section on page 73.\nVehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary\nsignificantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller\nvehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles\nhad an average contribution margin that was 118% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas\nour smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing\nemissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate\nthe transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers\nand dampen margins.\nTrade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions erect or intensify barriers to imports, or implement\ncurrency policy that advantages local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative\nimpact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free\ntrade, we have noted with concern recent developments in a number of regions. In Asia Pacific, a weak yen significantly\nreduces the cost of exports into the United States, Europe, and other global markets by Japanese manufacturers, and,\nover a period of time, contribute to other countries pursuing weak currency policies by intervening in the exchange rate\nmarkets. This is particularly likely in other Asian countries, such as South Korea. We believe the primary focus of the\nBiden administration will be addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and moving ahead with economic stimulus. We will\ncontinue to monitor and address developing issues.\nOther Economic Factors. Interest rates, notably mature market government bond yields, have remained lower than\nexpected. At the same time, inflation has accelerated and government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many\nmajor markets. The eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially\nhigher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital over our planning period. Higher interest rates and/or\ntaxes to address the higher deficits also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and, therefore, vehicle sales\nover our planning period.\n35\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 3399 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRevenue\nOur Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is\nrecorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales,\nthis occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration\nreceived when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or\nongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement\nin proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-\nready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are\nexpected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed\namount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue and profits\nrecognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon\ntransfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer.\nMost of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford\nCredit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer\u2019s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the\nrelevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer\u2019s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer\nthen pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer.\nOur Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables, net of certain deferred\norigination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue, and such revenue is recognized over the term of\nthe receivable using the interest method. Also, revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe term of the lease. Income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses, most of which are interest,\ndepreciation, and operating expenses.\nTransactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For\nexample, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers\u2019 customers who choose to finance or lease our\nvehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date\nthe related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease\npayments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it\noriginates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer\u2019s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount\nover the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a\nreduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of\ntransactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories:\n(i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to\nthe development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in\ncost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product\nrecall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts,\naccessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCertain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In\nour industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production\nvolumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production\nof model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic\nfactors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel.\nAs a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and\ncurrency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange\nlevels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories:\n\u2022 Contribution Costs \u2013 these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including\ncommodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs.\n\u2022 Structural Costs \u2013 these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume.\nThese costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales\npromotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs.\nWhile contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs\ncategory are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion\nwhen it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization\nexpense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary\ndirectly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we\nincrease overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as\nadvertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our\nstructural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in\nresponse to external factors.\nWe consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural\ncosts are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to\nincreasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share.\nCost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2021 were $126.6 billion. Our Automotive\nsegment\u2019s material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural\ncosts. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any\ncategory of costs.\n37\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 4411 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Structural costs include the following cost\ncategories:\n\u25aa Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing\npersonnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could\nbe affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules\n\u25aa Engineering and Connectivity \u2013 consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel,\nprototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services\n\u25aa Spending-Related \u2013 consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering\nassets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases\n\u25aa Advertising and Sales Promotions \u2013 includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions,\ncustomer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows\n\u25aa Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling \u2013 includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and\npurchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions\n\u25aa Pension and OPEB \u2013 consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee\nbenefit costs\n\u2022 Exchange \u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in\ncurrencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency\nincome to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies\nother than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging\n\u2022 Other \u2013 includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and\ncompensation-related changes\nIn addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include:\n\u2022 Wholesales and Revenue \u2013 wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by\nFord or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other\nmanufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China\njoint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nDefinitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors.\nIn general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit\u2019s EBT using the causal factors listed below:\n\u2022 Volume and Mix:\n\u25e6 Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average managed receivables\nat prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume\nchanges are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford\nCredit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides\nwholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored\nspecial financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding\n\u25e6 Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition\nof Ford Credit\u2019s average managed receivables by product within each region\n\u2022 Financing Margin:\n\u25e6 Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present\nperiod average managed receivables at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product\nand country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and\nscheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average managed receivables for the same period\n\u25e6 Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are\nprimarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive\nenvironment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing\nspreads, and asset-liability management\n\u2022 Credit Loss:\n\u25e6 Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes,\nmanagement splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit\nlosses\n\u25e6 Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and\nrecoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in\ncredit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit\u2019s present portfolio, changes in\ntrends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For\nadditional information, refer to the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section of Item 7\nof Part II of our 2021 Form 10-K Report\n\u2022 Lease Residual:\n\u25e6 Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis\npurposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in\naccumulated supplemental depreciation\n\u25e6 Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold,\nand the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and\naccumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental\ndepreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit\u2019s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of\nthe lease term, and changes in Ford Credit\u2019s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold.\nFor additional information, refer to the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles\nSubject to Operating Leases\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2021 Form 10-K Report\n\u2022 Exchange:\n\u25e6 Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars\n\u2022 Other:\n\u25e6 Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income at prior period\nexchange rates\n\u25e6 Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs\nassociated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts\n\u25e6 In general, other income changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation\nadjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items\n48\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 5522 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Corporate governance expenses are\nprimarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments.\nThese include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting\nthe Company\u2019s interests. For full year 2021, Corporate Other had a $1,084 million loss, compared with a $726 million loss\nin 2020.

See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial\nStatements for further information regarding our expected 2021 pension contributions and funded status.\nWe plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material\ncash requirements.\nChanges in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and\nnon-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending,\ndepreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes,\nand all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows).\nNon-operating items include: global redesign (including separation payments), changes in Company debt excluding Ford\nCredit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on\ninvestments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, and other transactions with Ford Credit).\nWith respect to \u201cChanges in working capital,\u201d in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables\ncompared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford\nCredit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast,\nour Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45\ndays. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade\npayables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding\nrevenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of\nproduction at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial\ndeterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19\nproduction levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal\neconomic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact\ncash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables\ndue to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale\nvolumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this\ntypically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.\n62\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 6666 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Such actions could have an adverse impact on our cash and\nincrease our inventory.\nFinancial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (\u201cSCF\u201d) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole\ndiscretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a\nnon-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe full year 2021 working capital impact was $1.7 billion negative, driven by higher inventory. All other and timing\ndifferences were negative $3.1 billion, reflecting assorted differences including differences between accrual-based EBIT\nand the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers; pension and OPEB income or\nexpense). We expect the working capital and timing differences to normalize when supply is restored, dealer stocks\nrebound, and incentives potentially increase.\nShareholder distributions were $400 million in 2021, all of which were attributable to the reinstatement of our regular\nquarterly dividend in the fourth quarter.\nWe previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business, pursuant to which we are working to turn\naround automotive operations, compete like a challenger, and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital, more\nresources, and more talent to our strongest business and vehicle franchises. Beginning with the actions we took in 2018,\nwe expect our global redesign to have a potential cash effect of about $7 billion. The cash effect related to our global\nredesign activities was $3.5 billion through December 31, 2021. For additional information on Global Redesign, see the\nOutlook section on page 73.\nAvailable Credit Lines. Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2021 were\n$18.3 billion, consisting of $13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, $2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit\nfacility, $1.5 billion of our delayed draw term loan facility, and $1.3 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2021,\nthe utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was $25 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit, and no\nportion of the supplemental revolving credit facility was utilized. The $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility was drawn\nin full in 2019 and remains outstanding. In addition, $847 million of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford\nCredit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2021.\nLenders under our corporate credit facility have $3.4 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and\n$10.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2026. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility\nhave $2.0 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024.\nIn September 2021, we amended the corporate and supplemental credit agreements to remove the restrictions on our\nability to repurchase shares or pay dividends. In addition, the agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets,\npursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the\nspecified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption,\nand Ford Europe CO tailpipe emissions. Further, interest on any U.S. dollar borrowings under both the corporate and\n2\nsupplemental revolving credit facilities will be calculated using daily simple SOFR. Prior to the amendments, such interest\nwas calculated using LIBOR.\nThe corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive\nfinancial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth\nrequirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment.

Ford Credit\u2019s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions\n(including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both\ninstitutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit\nsponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding\nthrough institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets.\nFord Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and\nthrough the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc (\u201cFCE\u201d) and Ford Bank GmbH (\u201cFord Bank\u201d).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities,\nincluding the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in\noperating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit\u2019s balance\nsheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and\ncash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This\npositive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded\nand is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios.\nThe following table shows Ford Credit\u2019s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and\nunsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions):\n2022 2023 2024 2025 and Beyond\nBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile\nAssets (a) $ 64 $ 92 $ 113 $ 135\nTotal debt (b) 53 76 92 118\nMemo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 14 11 11 22\n__________\n(a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to\nTrade and other receivables), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable\nsecurities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments.\n(b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments.\nMaturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to\ndepreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of\nfinance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit\u2019s\nretail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt\nmaturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities.\nAll wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if\nthe maturities extend beyond 2022. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities\nare assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, Ford Credit had $135 billion of assets, $74 billion of which were unencumbered.\nFunding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit\u2019s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are\nbeyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets (such as from the impact of COVID-19) that could impact\nboth unsecured debt and asset-backed securities and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets.\nDespite Ford Credit\u2019s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among\nothers, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence):\n\u2022 Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets;\n\u2022 Global capital market volatility;\n\u2022 Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit;\n\u2022 Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments;\n\u2022 General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers;\n\u2022 Ford Credit\u2019s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures;\n\u2022 Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit\u2019s asset-backed financing structures;\n\u2022 Inability to obtain hedging instruments;\n\u2022 Accounting and regulatory changes (including LIBOR); and\n\u2022 Ford Credit\u2019s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities.\nStress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can\ncontinue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-\nwide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance\nsheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of\nshort-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods,\nincluding 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit\u2019s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or\ncapital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing.\n68\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 7722 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES\nWe use both generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP financial measures for operational\nand financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures\nlisted below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to\naid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful\nperspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These\nnon-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used\nby other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.\n\u2022 Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) \u2013 Earnings\nbefore interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items.\nThis non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results\nand trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes\nspecial items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability\nand allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each\nitem (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows:\nPre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline\n\u2e30 Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses \u2e30 No minimum\n\u2e30 Gains and losses on investments in equity securities \u2e30 No minimum\n\u2e30 Personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related \u2e30 Generally $100 million or more\ncharges stemming from our efforts to match production\ncapacity and cost structure to market demand and changing\nmodel mix\n\u2e30 Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be \u2e30 $500 million or more for individual field\nindicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities service actions; generally $100 million or\nmore for other items\nWhen we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP\nmeasure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with\nreasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity\nsecurities.\n\u2022 Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) \u2013\nCompany Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure\nis useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry\nreporting.\n\u2022 Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) \u2013 Measure of\nCompany\u2019s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax\nspecial items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful\ninformation to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of the underlying run rate of our\nbusiness. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an\nearnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have\nnot yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB\nremeasurement gains and losses.\n\u2022 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) \u2013 Measure of Company\u2019s tax\nrate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing\neffective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for\nadjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will\ninclude potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable\ncertainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.\n75\n118811000099__FFoorrdd__22002211__AARR__11OOKK..iinndddd 7799 22//44//2222 11::5500 PPMM"}

Company adjusted EBIT will include the financial results of\nthese five reportable segments and Corporate Other, and net income will comprise the financial results of the five reportable segments and\nCorporate Other, as well as Interest on Debt, Special Items, and Taxes.\nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31, 2022.\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\nThe Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, and accessories worldwide, together with\nthe associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute, and service the vehicles, parts, and accessories. This segment includes revenues and\ncosts related to our electrification vehicle programs and enterprise connectivity. The segment includes the following regional business units:\nNorth America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group.\nGeneral\nOur vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln. In 2022, we sold approximately 4,231,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world. See \u201cItem\n7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (\u201cItem 7\u201d) for a discussion of our calculation of\nwholesale unit volumes.\nSubstantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively, \u201cdealerships\u201d), the substantial\nmajority of which are independently owned. At December 31, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands\nwas as follows:\nBrand 2021 2022\nFord 8,900 8,596\nFord-Lincoln (combined) 654 607\nLincoln 401 408\nTotal 9,955 9,611\nWe do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nIn addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers,\nincluding commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our\ndealerships (which, in turn, sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which, in turn, primarily sell these\nproducts to retailers). We also offer extended service contracts.\nThe worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we have little\ncontrol. Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing\nvehicle. The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geopolitical events, and other\nfactors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars, trucks, and utility vehicles and the availability and cost of financing and fuel). As a\nresult, the number of cars, trucks, and utility vehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year. Further, the automotive industry is a highly\ncompetitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers.\n2"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 3, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nOur wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand. Our wholesale unit volumes\nalso are influenced by the level of dealer inventory, and our ability to maintain sufficient production levels to support desired dealer inventory in\nthe event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our production. Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived\nby customers in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety,\nfuel efficiency, functionality, and reputation. Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions. Our ability to\nsatisfy changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics,\naffects our sales and earnings significantly.\nAs with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022 Wholesale unit volumes\n\u2022 Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which, in turn, is affected by many factors, such as:\n\u25e6 Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs)\n\u25e6 Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles\n\u25e6 Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions\n\u25e6 Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment\n\u2022 A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall\nprofitability\nAlthough recent supply disruptions have resulted in near-term upward pressure on new vehicle prices, our industry has historically had a\nvery competitive pricing environment, driven in part by excess capacity. For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have offered price\ndiscounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and maintain market share and production levels, and we are beginning\nto see indications that some of these actions will resume in 2023 as industry production and inventories improve. The decline in value of foreign\ncurrencies in the past has also contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets.\nCompetitive Position. The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer. Certain\nmanufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin.\nSeasonality. We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our\ndealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their\ncustomers). Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher\nin the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year). In recent years, due to\nCOVID-19, the semiconductor shortage, and other supply constraints, production has been higher in the second half of the year.\nBacklog Orders. During the past year, gross stock levels at dealers were lower than normal due largely to the semiconductor shortage and\nother supply constraints, and the amount of time required to fill orders for certain vehicles increased.\nRaw Materials. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the production of, and\ndevelopment of technologies in, our vehicles. These materials include base metals (e.g., steel and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium),\nenergy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene). As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase\nour reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries. We expect to have adequate supplies or\nsources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs; however, there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply\nof raw materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d\nfor a discussion of the risks associated with a shortage of components or raw materials, supplier disruptions, and inflationary pressures, the \u201cKey\nTrends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\u201d section of Item 7 for a discussion of supplier disruptions caused by a\nshortage of key components, as well as commodity and energy price changes, and \u201cItem 7A.

{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 6, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nFORD CREDIT SEGMENT\nThe Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis, which is primarily vehicle-related financing and\nleasing activities.\nFord Credit offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world. The predominant\nshare of Ford Credit\u2019s business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers. Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from\npayments made under retail installment sale and finance lease (retail financing) and operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases;\ninterest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our affiliates; and payments made under dealer financing programs.\nAs a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into\ntwo portfolios \u2014\u201cconsumer\u201d and \u201cnon-consumer.\u201d Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered\nto individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use. Retail financing\nincludes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases (comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases) for\nnew vehicles to retail and commercial customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.\nFinance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers. Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers\nto finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and\nimprovements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs. Ford Credit\nalso purchases receivables generated by us and our affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used\nvehicles from daily rental fleet companies. Ford Credit also provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees.\nThe majority of Ford Credit\u2019s business is in the United States and Canada. Outside of the United States, Europe is Ford Credit\u2019s largest\noperation. Ford Credit\u2019s European operations are managed primarily through its United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (\u201cFCE\u201d). Within\nEurope, Ford Credit\u2019s largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany.\nSee Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit\u2019s receivables, credit\nlosses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies. See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford\nCredit manages its financial market risks.\nWe routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers\u2019 customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from\nFord Credit. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted\nvalue of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer\u2019s customer. These programs\nincrease Ford Credit\u2019s financing volume and share. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for\nthese programs.\nWe have a Third Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford Credit\u2019s financial statement\nleverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 12.5:1 (as reported in its most recent periodic report), Ford Credit could require us to\nmake or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such financial statement leverage to have been\n12.5:1. No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement. In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit has agreed to\nmaintain FCE\u2019s net worth in excess of $500 million. No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.\nFord Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit. The reports are available through\nFord Credit\u2019s website located at www.fordcredit.com/investor-center and can also be found on the SEC\u2019s website located at www.sec.gov.\nThe foregoing information regarding Ford Credit\u2019s website and its content is for convenience only and not deemed to be incorporated by\nreference into this Report nor filed with the SEC.\n6"}

Business (Continued)\nCORPORATE OTHER\nCorporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our extended service\ncontract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n(excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with\nintercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are\nnot allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship,\nand promoting the Company\u2019s interests.\nEffective January 1, 2023, past service pension and other postretirement employee benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) income/expense and related assets,\npreviously reported in the Automotive segment, were realigned to Corporate Other.\nINTEREST ON DEBT\nInterest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.\nGOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS\nMany governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling,\nsubstances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment. In addition,\nmanufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the\nhandling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below:\nVehicle Emissions Control\nU.S. Requirements - Federal and California Tailpipe Emission Standards. Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and the\nCalifornia Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emissions standards that become increasingly\nstringent over time. Seventeen states have adopted California\u2019s light-duty standards, four states have adopted California\u2019s heavy-duty standards,\nand other states are expected to join. Both federal and California regulations also require motor vehicles to be equipped with on-board diagnostic\n(\u201cOBD\u201d) systems that monitor emission-related systems and components. In addition, light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines\nmust be certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant states. Canada accepts EPA\ncertification. Compliance with emissions standards, OBD requirements, and related regulations can be challenging and can drive increased\nproduct development costs, warranty costs, and vehicle recalls.\nCARB has adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 heavy-duty engines, as well as extended heavy-duty warranty\nrequirements beginning with the 2022 model year, and EPA has proposed more stringent heavy-duty standards beginning with the 2027 model\nyear. These rules include more stringent emissions standards, as well as new requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD.\nCARB has also adopted new light-duty emissions standards applicable to 2026 model year vehicles, including a more stringent emissions\nstandard and other new emissions requirements. These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development\nof light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.\nCompliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive\nfuels that the vehicles were designed to use. Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and\nstate levels could affect vehicle manufacturers\u2019 warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards.\n7"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 8, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nThe California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission\nvehicles (\u201cZEVs\u201d). California\u2019s light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward,\nmandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. For 2025 model year, this\nregulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer\u2019s California light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs. In August 2022, California\napproved a sweeping revision to the ZEV regulation. Beginning with the 2026 model year, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% ZEV sales\nrequirement, rising to 100% by 2035. The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage, and new requirements for EV\nbattery durability. California has also instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model\nyear. These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could entail significant costs and compliance\nchallenges, and include complex warranty and recall requirements. Compliance with ZEV rules depends on market conditions (including the\npace of adoption of EVs), technology readiness, and battery raw material availability as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to\nsupport vehicle charging.\nEuropean Requirements. European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount of regulated\npollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom. Regulatory stringency has increased\nsignificantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in 2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for\nCO and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or \u201cRDE\u201d). These\n2\non-road emission tests are in addition to the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017). The divergence between the regulatory limit that is\ntested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands\nincrease. In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation, and the lead-\ntime for engineering and type approval may potentially be too short. The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are\nsignificant, and following the EU Commission\u2019s indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication \u201cEU Green Deal\u201d\nas well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom. In\naddition, the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (\u201cWVTA\u201d) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance. Moreover,\nfollowing the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which could\nincrease vehicle complexity and duties.\nThere is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles. The access rules being introduced\nare developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities.\nThe speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase. In an effort to\nsupport the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by\n2\nwhen internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in\n2030.\nOther National Requirements. Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are adopting previous\nversions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\u201cUN-ECE\u201d) mobile source emission regulations. Some countries\nhave adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations. For example, the China Stage VI\nlight-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling\nemissions standards, and CARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions. Under the level one (VI(a))\nstandard, which is currently in place nationwide in China, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon\nmonoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit. The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard\u2019s emissions limits are approximately 30-\n50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutant. While level two (VI(b)) is not slated for nationwide implementation until July\n2023, the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation. For example,\nBeijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province, and Guangdong province have all begun implementing level two (VI(b)). Both China Stage VII light-\nduty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission regulations are currently under pre-study, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has\nadvised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily\nCO ) tailpipe emissions. In South America, most countries are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and U.S.\n2\nregulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles and European\nregulations for heavy-duty vehicles.\n8"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 9, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nCanadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements; however, the existing ZEV regulations in Quebec and\nthose published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in California. Both British Columbia and Quebec have\nproposed draft amendments to their regulations to increase requirements starting in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The federal government has\npublished draft light-duty ZEV sales requirements through an amendment to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas\nEmission Regulations and has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles. Other provinces have\nsignaled their interest in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are awaiting the finalization of the federal ZEV regulations.\nElsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards. Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel\nquality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted. This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use\nsurveillance requirements are implemented.\nGlobal Developments. In recent years, EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of \u201cdefeat devices.\u201d Defeat devices are\nelements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal\non-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification. They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do\nnot use defeat devices in our vehicles.\nRegulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers\u2019 emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by\nvarious manufacturers. EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program. CARB has also been\nconducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles. In the past,\nseveral European countries have conducted non-standard emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental\ntesting has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices. Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis. In\naddition, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which\ncould, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.\nVehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards\nU.S. Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles. Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy\n(\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d). Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties\nif they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and\nexpected credits for the three succeeding model years. The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards\napplicable to each manufacturer\u2019s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.\nEPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions under the Clean Air Act. Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a\nvehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy standards. Thus, NHTSA and EPA coordinate\nwith each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.\nBeginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came\nto be known as the \u201cOne National Program\u201d (\u201cONP\u201d) framework. California, which had promulgated its own state-specific set of GHG regulations,\nagreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of\npotentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards. ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent year-over-year\nstandards.\nONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year. In 2020, EPA introduced significantly less stringent fuel economy and\nGHG standards applicable to model years 2021-2026. The federal government also revoked California\u2019s authority to set and enforce its own\nvehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that opted in to California\u2019s standards. California continued to assert its authority\nto regulate vehicle GHGs, challenged in court the federal government\u2019s preemption actions, withdrew from ONP, and planned to return to\nenforcing its own state-specific GHG standards.\n9"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 10, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nThe litigation over both standards and preemption, with uncertain outcomes, created difficulty for purposes of Ford\u2019s future product planning.\nTo avoid a \u201cbifurcated\u201d regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted California\u2019s GHG standards enforce one set\nof rules, while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an\nalternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory\nprogram. This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis, while being consistent with Ford\u2019s environmental\ngoals. Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020, and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect\nthe agreement.\nIn 2021, EPA again re-evaluated the stringency of light-duty fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year, and considered\nwhether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels, or greater. EPA finalized this evaluation in December 2021, establishing GHG\nstandards applicable to model years 2023-2026 with stringency that exceeded ONP levels. In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel\neconomy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially aligned with EPA\u2019s GHG standards. The federal government also acted\nin December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking California\u2019s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of\nother states that adopted California\u2019s standards, and EPA took similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act. In late 2022, EPA began\nconsideration of sweeping changes to light-duty GHG regulations for model years 2027 and beyond. These regulations are expected to extend\nthrough at least the 2030 model year, and to drive significant ZEV sales mix, along with rapid improvement of ICE vehicle performance, by virtue\nof greatly increased stringency. These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty\nvehicles. If any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions,\nFord would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations.\nSuch actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for Ford\u2019s\nmost fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or\nfull-size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.\nU.S. Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles. EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards for heavy-duty\nvehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating) through the 2027 model year, and EPA is preparing a major update\nto these standards for the 2027 model year and beyond. In Ford\u2019s case, the standards primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus\nvocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks. As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult\nto comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.\nEuropean Requirements. The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO emissions using sliding scales\n2\nwith different CO targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a\n2\ncalendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet\nthe individual CO targets. Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have\n2\nentered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other\nmanufacturers to benefit from our positive CO performance. For \u201cmulti-stage vehicles\u201d (e.g., Ford\u2019s Transit chassis cabs), the base\n2\nmanufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO performance of the final up-fitted vehicles. The initial target levels get significantly more\n2\nstringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant investments in\npropulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO emissions. The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced\n2\nsimilar rules, and the United Kingdom is considering adopting ZEV mandates.\nThe EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and heavy-duty vehicles are\n2\naddressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges. As discussed above, the EU Commission has announced a\n\u201cGreen Deal\u201d that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO emissions (including stricter CO fleet regulations) and other regulated\n2 2\nemissions and include recycling and substance restrictions. While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more\nambitious 2030 interim target (a 55% instead of 40% CO reduction compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted\n2\nstricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.\nFord also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due\nto, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.\n10"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 11, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nThe United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO . This world light-duty test procedure (\u201cWLTP\u201d) is\n2\nfocused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO and fuel consumption figures with customer-reported figures. The introduction of WLTP in\n2\nEurope started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO labeling, thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO tax scheme as well as\n2 2\nCO fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are\n2\nsignificant.\nSome European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO vehicle emissions, including fiscal\n2\nmeasures and CO labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord. For example, the United Kingdom, France,\n2\nGermany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO emissions. The EU CO requirements\n2 2\nare likely to trigger further measures. In addition, delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging\ninfrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low CO emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced, can trigger\n2\ncompliance risks in all European markets.\nOther National Requirements. The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental\nProtection Act. In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for light-duty vehicles, which\nmaintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025 model years. The revised U.S. EPA standards were automatically\nadopted in Canada by reference for the 2022-2025 model years, and draft amendments for a few standalone administrative elements not\nautomatically adopted by reference were published in December 2022. The heavy-duty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the\n2021 model year and beyond were published in May 2018 and are in line with U.S. requirements, subject to any change in those requirements.\nChina\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle (\u201cNEV\u201d) Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel consumption\nrequirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles, i.e., plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles. The fuel\nconsumption requirement uses a weight-based approach to establish targets, with year-over-year target reductions. China set a target of\n5.0L/100km for the 2020 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption fleet average, which lowers to 4.0L/100km by 2025 based on the New\nEuropean Driving Cycle system. The government is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction in 2030, and is targeting 3.5L/100km based\non the WLTP cycle (\u201cWLTC\u201d) system. The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year, with NEV\ncredits of at least 16%, 18%, 28%, and 38% of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volume required in 2022, 2023, 2024, and\n2025, respectively. Future percentages are currently under consideration.\nAs discussed below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety,\nemissions, fuel economy, autonomous vehicle, and other regulations,\u201d a production disruption, stop ship, lower than planned market acceptance\nof our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with\nfuel economy standards.\nVehicle Safety\nU.S. Requirements. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the \u201cSafety Act\u201d) regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in\ntwo primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to\napplicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve\nas global compliance and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment Programs (\u201cNCAPs\u201d), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (\u201cIIHS\u201d))\nrequirements continue to evolve, are increasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally. As we expand our business priorities to include\nautonomous vehicles and broader mobility products and services, our financial exposure has increased. Second, the Safety Act requires that\ndefects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it\ndetermines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance\nissue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\nEuropean Requirements. The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent\nrequirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-vehicle data, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.\n11"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 12, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1. Business (Continued)\nThe European General Safety Regulation (\u201cGSR\u201d) introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval\nprocess. The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features, including cybersecurity requirements for\nnew vehicle models from 2022 and for all registrations in 2024. EU regulators are focusing on active safety features, such as lane departure\nwarning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist. Furthermore, mobile network providers in certain EU Member States\nhave begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing vehicles. The e-Call\nsystems in existing vehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out. It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member\nStates to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.\nOther National Requirements. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor variations to\naddress local concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the\ndevelopment of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while\nproviding a common level of safety performance; several on-going bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal.\nSafety and recall requirements in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Gulf Cooperation Council (\u201cGCC\u201d) countries may add substantial\ncosts and complexity to our global recall practice. Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties are applied if these levels are not\nmaintained, while a tax reduction may be available for over-performance. In Canada, regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S.\nregulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit\na notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. In 2021, Canada started preliminary\nconsultations on several new proposed regulations, including Administrative Monetary Penalties (\u201cAMPs\u201d) and Analysis of Technical Information\nfor Vehicles and Equipment (\u201cACTIVE\u201d) regulations. Draft language for the AMPs regulation was published in May 2022 with final regulations\nexpected to be published at the end of 2023. In China, a new mandatory Event Data Recorder regulation that is more comprehensive than U.S.\nrequirements has been released, and in China, Malaysia, and South Korea, mandatory e-Call requirements are being drafted. E-Call is\nmandatory in the UAE for new vehicles starting with the 2021 model year, and in Saudi Arabia from the 2025 model year.\nNew Car Assessment Programs. Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to provide consumers and\nbusinesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than\nwhat is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the\nlowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which may vary by country or region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles. Similarly, environmental\nrating systems exist in various regions, e.g., Green NCAP in Europe. In China, C-NCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number\nof five-star ratings. Further, the China Insurance Auto Safety Index (similar to IIHS) has been implemented, with higher standards for passenger\nand pedestrian protection and driver assistance technologies. These protocols impose additional requirements relating to testing, evaluation, and\nmandatory safety features, and compliance with them (or any subsequent updates to them) may be costly.\n12"}

Ford maintains an Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and\ntop leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of the\nbusiness plan. Key topic areas include Compensation & Retention, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d), Organization Design, Talent Planning\n& Development, and Culture.\nOur Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters, including items discussed at the\nExecutive People Forum. The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review, discuss, and set strategic\ndirection for various people-related business strategies, including: compensation and benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture;\nDEI; and talent development programs. The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising\nmanagement on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies, the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term\npreservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing, including human rights, working conditions, and responsible sourcing.\nThe collective recommendations to the Board and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and create an employee\nexperience that allows employees and our organization to thrive.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nAt Ford, we believe that creating a Culture of Inclusion for all our employees is both foundational to achieving our Ford+ plan and the right\nthing to do. Ford offers 12 Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) that represent various dimensions of our employee population, including racial,\nethnic, gender, religious, sexual orientation and gender identity, ability, and generational communities with chapters throughout the world, in\naddition to Ford Advocacy for Belonging (\u201cFAB\u201d) Councils in every region. Our ERGs and FAB Councils are instrumental in providing a voice to\nour globally diverse workforce as well as sharing valuable insights into the development of products, services, and experiences.\nOur business has developed DEI action plans specific to each region\u2019s unique needs and culture. From an enterprise perspective, we have\ntaken several concrete steps to further these efforts, including embedding DEI into our corporate strategy and governance, ensuring that\nrevisions to employee expected behaviors enable an inclusive culture, and establishing objectives for progress for every salaried employee. This\nholistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on racial equity, growing representation of diverse talent throughout the pipeline, and DEI education.\nOur diversity statistics include the following as of December 31, 2022 (based on self-reporting at the date of hire): 28.8% of our salaried\nemployees worldwide are females (excludes certain employees in Europe in accordance with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection\nRegulation); 25.4% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are females; and 36.2% of our total salaried and hourly\nemployees in the United States are minorities.\nTalent Attraction, Growth, and Capability Assessment\nThe workplace is quickly evolving, and new working practices are constantly developing. Many employees are no longer bound to physical\nlocations, where and how we source our talent is evolving, and employee expectations have shifted. From a growth perspective, we are focused\non several key areas vital to our success (e.g., software, electrification, and data science). Ford continues to accelerate its efforts to attract new\nemployees with diverse skill sets and capabilities, and more resources have been dedicated to recruiting these employees, who are critical to\nsupporting our business model.\nFrom a capability perspective, we are leveraging best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen our current\ncapabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging, collaboration, empowerment, and innovation. The performance\nmanagement process is reviewed regularly to ensure we set clear expectations, measure individual performance, and reward appropriately. We\nare also creating targeted learning experiences, democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization, and\nempowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future.\n13"}

Our Leadership+ mechanism for developing People Leaders guides how we think about performance management and how we\nassess our talent to meet our organizational needs. Leadership+ will continue to prepare and empower our People Leaders to lead our teams\nthrough significant change at our Company and in our industry.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nNothing is more important than the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees, and we consistently strive to achieve world-class levels of\nsafety through the application of sound policies and best practices. We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries, supported\nby effective communication, reporting, and external benchmarking. We verify compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our internal\nsafety standards and regularly report to Company management on key safety issues, including significant incidents and high potential near-\nmisses, to prevent recurrences. We also participate in multi-industry groups, within and outside the automotive sector, to share safety best\npractices and collaborate to address common issues.\nOur Safety Record\nAny loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable and deeply regretted. Unfortunately, there were two fatal incidents in 2022\nin our China region. Another key safety indicator is our global lost-time case rate (\u201cLTCR\u201d), which is defined as the number of cases where one\nor more working days is lost due to work-related injury/illness per 200,000 hours worked. While our global LTCR remains stable overall, there\nwas an increase to 0.39 in 2022 from 0.35 in 2021. We will continue our efforts to reduce workplace injuries.\nEmployee Wellbeing Initiatives\nOur global, holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and professional needs of our\nemployees. Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees, build\ncapability, and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals. Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we\nwork to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions\nflexibility and choice to meet their specific needs.\nWe use data-driven insights gathered through surveys, focus groups, and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our\nwellbeing efforts. We provide global wellbeing programs, such as Employee Assistance Programs and mindfulness sessions, among other\nthings. In addition, we provide employees with experiences, self-guided tools, and social connection opportunities, as well as access to the\nprofessional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense of wellbeing. We are committed to creating an environment where\nemployees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford+.\nEmployee Sentiment Strategy\nWe leverage our ask/listen/observe framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford. This approach is a holistic and consistent\nmethodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly. Our measurement focuses on several\nareas that are key to our business: Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing, Health & Safety, Employee Experience, Culture, DEI,\nLeadership, and Strategic Alignment. Our employee sentiment surveys guide the actions we take to address employee concerns and related\nrisks, and also help us understand whether our efforts to drive change in these areas are effective.\nA critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best positioned to drive\nmeaningful change. To this end, leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their teams and organizations, as well as\npersonalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools. Our measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of\nfocus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of talent initiatives across the enterprise.\n14"}

Risk Factors.\nWe have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories: Operational Risks; Macroeconomic,\nMarket, and Strategic Risks; Financial Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks.\nOperational Risks\nFord and Ford Credit\u2019s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by\npublic health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19. We face various risks related to public health issues, including\nepidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in\nconsumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created\nsignificant volatility in the global economy. There have been extraordinary actions taken by international, federal, state, and local public health\nand governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions throughout the world, including travel\nbans, quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many\nbusinesses to curtail or cease normal operations. For example, in 2020, consistent with the actions taken by governmental authorities, we idled\nour manufacturing operations in regions around the world before ultimately resuming our manufacturing operations taking a phased approach\nand after introducing new safety protocols at our plants. To the extent cases surge in any locations, stringent limitations on daily activities that\nmay have been eased previously could be reinstated in those areas. A future suspension of our manufacturing operations could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause\nintermittent disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. For example, in China, outbreaks of COVID-19 have led the\ngovernment to impose lockdowns and other restrictions, which have adversely affected our and our supply chain\u2019s production operations, our\nwholesales, and consumer demand for our products. Further, as new strains or variants of COVID-19 or other viruses, diseases, or public health\nissues develop or sufficient amounts of vaccines or treatments are not available, not widely administered for a significant period of time, or\notherwise prove ineffective, the impact of a widespread public health issue on the global economy, and, in turn, our financial condition, liquidity,\nand results of operations could be material.\nThe predominant share of Ford Credit\u2019s business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles, and the duration or resurgence of public\nhealth issues such as COVID-19 may negatively impact the level of originations at Ford Credit. For example, Ford\u2019s suspension of\nmanufacturing operations, a significant decline in dealer showroom traffic, and/or a reduction of operations at dealers may lead to a significant\ndecline in Ford Credit\u2019s consumer and non-consumer originations. Moreover, economic uncertainty and higher unemployment arising from\nwidespread public health issues or otherwise may result in higher defaults in Ford Credit\u2019s consumer portfolio, and prolonged unemployment\nmay have a negative impact on both new and used vehicle demand.\nAs described in more detail below under \u201cFord and Ford Credit\u2019s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at\ncompetitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory\nrequirements, or other factors,\u201d the volatility created by COVID-19 adversely affected Ford and Ford Credit\u2019s access to the debt and\nsecuritization markets and its cost of funding, and any volatility in the capital markets as a result of a public health issue or for any other reason\ncould have an adverse impact on Ford and Ford Credit\u2019s access to those markets and its cost of funding.\nThe full impact of COVID-19 or any widespread public health issue on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on the\nduration and scope of an outbreak (including any potential future waves, the emergence or re-emergence of variants and their transmissibility,\nand the success of vaccination programs and treatments), its impact on our customers, dealers, and suppliers, how quickly normal economic\nconditions, operations, and the demand for our products can resume, and any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause. For\nexample, the duration of a suspension of manufacturing operations and a return to our full production schedule will depend, in part, on not only a\nsufficient number of employees being able to return to work but also whether our suppliers and dealers have resumed normal operations. Our\nFord Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing operations are suspended, but we\ncontinue to incur operating and non-operating expenses, resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow. Accordingly, any significant future disruption\nto our production schedule, regionally or globally, whether as a result of our own or a supplier\u2019s suspension of operations, could have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. Moreover, our supply and distribution chains may be\ndisrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or their permanent discontinuation of operations triggered by a shutdown of operations due to a\nwidespread public health issue or for other reasons.\n16"}

Risk Factors (Continued)\nPublic health issues may also exacerbate other risks disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K Report, including, but not limited to, our\ncompetitiveness, demand or market acceptance for our products and services, and shifting consumer preferences, and our ability to successfully\nexecute our strategy.\nFord is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford\u2019s production schedule and\nspecifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium,\ncobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford\u2019s production of vehicles. Our products contain components that we source\nglobally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their suppliers. If there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain or a\nsupplier is unable to deliver a component to us in accordance with our specifications, because of a production issue, limited availability of\nmaterials, shipping problems, restrictions on transactions with certain countries or companies, or other reason, and the component cannot be\neasily sourced from a different supplier, or we are unable to obtain a component on a timely basis, the shortage may disrupt our operations or\nincrease our costs of production. For example, the automotive industry continues to face a significant shortage of semiconductors, which has a\ncomplex supply chain with long lead times required to increase production and capacity. The shortage is due in large part to strong cross-\nindustry demand, which has presented challenges and production disruptions globally, including at our assembly plants, and COVID-19-related\nwork restrictions in various parts of the world have further impacted semiconductor production. Accordingly, we and our competitors who need\nintegrated circuits are experiencing various levels of semiconductor impact.\nFor the production of our electric vehicles, we are dependent on the supply of batteries and the raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel,\ngraphite, and manganese) used by our suppliers to produce those batteries. As we increase our production of electric vehicles, we expect our\nneed for such materials to increase significantly. At the same time, other companies are increasing their production of electric vehicles, which will\nfurther increase the demand for such raw materials. As a result, we may be unable to acquire raw materials needed for electric vehicle\nproduction in sufficient amounts that are responsibly sourced or at reasonable prices. As described below under \u201cTo facilitate access to the raw\nmaterials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments\nto raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are\ndifficult to accurately forecast\u201d as well as in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 below, we have entered into, and expect to\ncontinue to enter into, offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts that obligate us, subject to certain conditions such as quality\nor minimum output, to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output from certain raw materials suppliers. In the event the\nsupplier under those agreements or any of our or our suppliers\u2019 raw material supply contracts is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of raw\nmaterials needed for our or our suppliers\u2019 production operations, e.g., if a mine does not produce at expected levels, or the raw materials do not\notherwise satisfy our requirements, and we or our suppliers are unable to find an alternative resource with sufficient quantities, at reasonable\nprices, responsibly sourced, and in a timely manner, it could impact our ability to produce electric vehicles.\nA shortage of, or our inability to acquire or find adequate suppliers of, key components or raw materials as a result of disruptions in the\nsupply chain, capacity constraints, limited availability, competition for those items within the automotive industry and other sectors, or otherwise\ncan cause a significant disruption to our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nTo facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to\ncontinue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future\ndemand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast. We have announced plans to\nsignificantly increase our electric vehicle production volumes; however, our ability to produce higher volumes of electric vehicles is dependent\nupon the availability of raw materials necessary for the production of batteries, e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among\nothers. As described above under \u201cFord is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford\u2019s production\nschedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium,\ncobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford\u2019s production of vehicles,\u201d to facilitate our access to such raw materials, we have\nentered into, and expect to continue to enter into, offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts. Such agreements obligate us,\nsubject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output, to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output from raw\nmaterial suppliers over an agreed upon period of time pursuant to an agreed upon purchase price mechanism that is typically based upon the\nmarket price of the material at the time of delivery.\n17"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 18, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nUnlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, which are typically annual commitments, under multi-year offtake agreements and other\nlong-term purchase contracts, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery\ntechnology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers. In the event we do not purchase the\nmaterials pursuant to the terms of these agreements, even if the supplier finds another purchaser, we may be obligated to reimburse the supplier\nfor costs it incurs in finding the new purchaser as well as any lost revenue attributable to the replacement purchaser paying a lower price than\nrequired under the pricing mechanism in our agreement.\nAs a result of the competition for and limited availability of the raw materials needed for our electric vehicle business, the costs of such\nmaterials are difficult to accurately forecast as they may fluctuate during the term of the offtake agreements and other long-term purchase\ncontracts based on market conditions. Accordingly, we may be subject to increases in the prices we pay for those raw materials, and our ability\nto recoup such costs through increased pricing to our customers may be limited. As a result, our margins, results of operations, financial\ncondition, and reputation may be adversely impacted by commitments we make pursuant to offtake agreements and other long-term purchase\ncontracts.\nFord\u2019s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+. We previously announced our plan for growth and\nvalue creation \u2013 Ford+. Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus \u201cAlways-On\u201d customer relationships and\nuser experiences. Our Ford+ plan is designed to leverage our foundational strengths to build new capabilities \u2013 enriching customer experiences\nand deepening loyalty. As we undertake this transformation of our business, we must integrate our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business\nmodel, and balance competing priorities, or we will not be successful. To facilitate this transformation, we are making substantial investments,\nrecruiting new talent, and optimizing our business model, management system, and organization. Accordingly, maintaining discipline in our\ncapital allocation continues to be important, as a strong core business and a balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in these new\ngrowth opportunities is critical to the success of our Ford+ plan. If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles, services,\ntechnology, and other calls on capital, or we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford+ (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control),\nwe may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect, it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism,\nwhich may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFord\u2019s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty\ncosts. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a\nmanufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. We may also be obligated to\nremedy defects or potentially recall our vehicles due to defective components provided to us by our suppliers, arising from their quality issues or\notherwise. NHTSA\u2019s enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct\noversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers\u2019 safety processes, a trend that could continue. Should we or government safety regulators\ndetermine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch\nof such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied. The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in vehicles\nthat have been sold could be substantial, particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after\nproduction. For example, NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata\ndesiccated airbag inflators in the United States. Of these, approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles. Should\nNHTSA determine that the inflators contain a safety defect, Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall\ncosts. Further, to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers, our ability to\nrecover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers\u2019 financial condition. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages\nand field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold, and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis. In addition, from time\nto time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. For additional information\nregarding warranty and field service action costs, including our process for establishing our reserves, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Item\n7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and\ncomponent complexity, the adoption of new technologies, or otherwise, such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or\nresults of operations. Furthermore, launch delays, recall actions, and increased warranty costs could adversely affect our reputation or market\nacceptance of our products as discussed below under \u201cFord\u2019s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject\nto market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services\nindustries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.\u201d\n18"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 19, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures,\nrestructurings, or new business strategies. We have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced or formed joint ventures with\na number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies. These initiatives\ntypically involve enormous complexity, may require a significant amount of capital, and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process. As a\nresult, we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the\nbenefits may be delayed. For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the\nimplementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered\nduring due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the\nother party. Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the\njoint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems. In order to\nsecure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other\nlong-term purchase contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers; however, we may\nnot realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers, particularly those in less developed markets, adopt\nFord\u2019s sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation. In addition, a\nrestructuring or the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations,\nincluding distracting management from current operations. Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities,\nand, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments, which may be significant, in that strategy. Moreover, we may continue to\nhave financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market, and restructuring actions may cause us to incur\nsignificant costs, record impairments or other charges, subject us to potential claims from employees, suppliers, dealers, or governmental\nauthorities or harm our reputation. Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or strategies described\nherein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOperational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and\nother disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers. We rely on information technology networks\nand systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store\nelectronic information that is important to the operation of our business, our vehicles, and the services we offer. Despite security measures, we\nare at risk for interruptions, outages, and compromises of: (i) operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, product\ndevelopment, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or\nmobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber attack, security breach, or other reasons, e.g., a natural disaster, fire, acts of\nterrorism or war, or an overburdened infrastructure system. Such incidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade\nsecrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or\nothers; jeopardize the security of our facilities; affect the performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our\nvehicles. This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity. Moreover, we, our suppliers, and\nour dealers have been the target of cyber attacks in the past, and such attacks will continue and evolve in the future, which may cause cyber\nincidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time. Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be\nimpacted by, or a data breach may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and\nsystems. We continually employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks,\nand we rely on our suppliers to do the same for their operations; however, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities and such preventative\nmeasures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, including potential\nproduction disruption. Moreover, a cyber incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or\nsubject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cyber incident involving us or\none of our suppliers could impact production, our internal operations, or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.\n19"}

Risk Factors (Continued)\nFord\u2019s production, as well as Ford\u2019s suppliers\u2019 production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted\nby labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity\nlimitations, or other factors. A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford\u2019s facilities, at a facility in its supply chain, or\nat one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons, including as a result of labor issues, including shortages of available employees,\ndisputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining\nagreements, absenteeism, public health issues (e.g., COVID-19), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions (e.g.,\nplant closures); as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of components, including but\nnot limited to semiconductors, or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other difficulties; as a result of a natural disaster (including\nclimate-related physical risk); cyber incidents; or for other reasons. Further, the limited availability of components, labor shortages, COVID-19,\nand supplier operating issues has led to an inconsistent production schedule at our facilities. This has exacerbated the disruption to our\nsuppliers\u2019 operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls.\nGiven the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations, we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or operating inefficiencies that\nmay increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather\nand other natural events, e.g., wildfires, extended droughts, and extreme temperatures. In addition, in the event a weather-related event, strike,\ninternational conflict, or other occurrence limits the ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or\nlogistics providers to transport our vehicles for an extended period of time, it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our\nproduction operations and customers\u2019 ability to receive our vehicles.\nMany components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore, cannot be re-sourced\nquickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier\nbefore ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.). Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in\nnegotiations. In addition, when we undertake a model changeover, significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be\nrequired, and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier\u2019s\nfacility. Moreover, as vehicles, components, and their integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production\nof new vehicles. Regardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited. Accordingly, a significant disruption to our\nproduction schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to\ncomply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply\nwith safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.\u201d\nFord\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints. The vast majority of the hourly\nemployees in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and\nsome degree of income security, subject to certain conditions. These agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses. A\nsubstantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting\nretention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close\nmanufacturing or other facilities.\nFord\u2019s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who are highly skilled in engineering,\nsoftware, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), marketing, and finance, among other areas. Competition for such\nemployees is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a tight labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for\nemployers. We have struggled to hire and retain salaried, skilled hourly, and production hourly employees in some of our manufacturing and\nparts, supplies, and logistics locations. In addition to compensation considerations, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a\npremium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements,\nand other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. If we are not perceived as an employer\nof choice, we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees. Further, if we lose existing employees with needed skills, or we are unable to\nupskill and develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new technologies, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\n20"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 21, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nMacroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks\nFord\u2019s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face\nsignificant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its\nreputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced. Although we conduct extensive market research\nbefore launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of\nnew or existing products and services in the marketplace, and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or\npreferences or the success of new products or services in the market. It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing\nvehicle. Because customers\u2019 preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and\nat costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs. Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the\nrisks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms\nof price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. For example, if we are unable to\ndifferentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor our\nproducts and services to customers in other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and services, which could have an\nadverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWith increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety,\nfuel efficiency, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of\nour products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded. Further, our ability to successfully grow through\ncapacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and software services depends on\nmany factors, including advancements in technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging\nnetwork), and other factors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles, digital and\nphysical services, and software services. The automotive, software, and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing\nrapid changes. Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of competitors (particularly in our areas of strength, e.g.,\npick-up trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles) that may possess superior technology, may have business models with certain aspects that are\nmore efficient, and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us, are entering the market. This level of competition increases the\nimportance of our ability to anticipate, develop, and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line\nwith demand, and at costs low enough to be profitable.\nWe have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and software services. Our plans include\noffering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit. If the market for electrified vehicles does not\ndevelop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative\nperception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, or if consumers prefer our competitors\u2019 vehicles, there could be an adverse\nimpact on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, as discussed below under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product\nplans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,\u201d lower\nthan planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards.\nFord is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris\nAgreement) by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles, operations, and supply chain. We have announced interim\nemissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and made other statements about similar initiatives, e.g., our\nexpected electric vehicle volumes in future years. Achievement of these initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of\nnew processes; however, there is no assurance that the desired outcomes will be achieved. To the extent we are unable to achieve these\ninitiatives or our transition to electrification is slower than expected, it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected\nreturn on the investment. For example, we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO emissions in line with our targets or\n2\nin compliance with applicable regulations. Further, our customers and investors evaluate how well we are progressing on our announced climate\ngoals and aspirations, and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and aspirations on a timely basis, or if the expectations of our customers\nand investors change and we do not adequately address their expectations, our reputation could be impacted, and customers may choose to\npurchase the products and services of, investors may choose to invest in, and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other\ncompanies.\n21"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 22, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nMoreover, new offerings, including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, may present technological\nchallenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated. In\naddition, since new technologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any manufacturer\u2019s autonomous vehicle may\nnegatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust.\nFord\u2019s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States. A shift in consumer\npreferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other\nvehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. If demand\nfor electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles, lower market share and\nrevenue, as well as facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation) associated with the production of internal combustion\nvehicles, may result. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and\nlow emission zones) and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the\nperceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.\nWith a global footprint, Ford\u2019s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including\nprotectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events. Because of the interconnectedness of the global economy, the challenges of a\npandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, war, geopolitical crises, or other significant events in one area of\nthe world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world. Changes in international trade policy can also have\na substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs\non automobiles, parts, and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our\nbusiness, and may lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for\ncustomers, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive. In particular, China presents unique risks to U.S. automakers due to the strain\nin U.S.-China relations, China\u2019s unique regulatory landscape, and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain.\nFord has operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments. This may expose us to heightened risks as a result\nof economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual\nproperty, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war\nor expansion of hostilities (such as the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine), and acts of terrorism, each of which could impact our supply chain\nas well as our operations and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, the U.S. government,\nother governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing\nbusiness directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.\nIndustry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event.\nBecause we, like other manufacturers, have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can\nhave a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations. Vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions and\ndeveloping trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the transportation as a service model, e.g., ridesharing services. If industry vehicle\nsales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flow. For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.\nFord may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity,\ncurrency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors. The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with installed\nmanufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand. Historically, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering\nmarketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of\nsubsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives. As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset\nhigher marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations. This risk includes cost\nadvantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable those competitors to\noffer their products at lower prices. Further, higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing, which may have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. As the automotive industry transitions to electric vehicles, excess capacity, particularly for internal\ncombustion engine trucks and utilities, may continue or increase. This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of\nthe market, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n22"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 23, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nInflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and\nmarket value of Ford or Ford Credit\u2019s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results. We and our\nsuppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices,\nforeign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management\nprogram, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business. Changes in\ncommodity and energy prices (from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, as discussed above under \u201cWith a global footprint, Ford\u2019s\nresults could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other\nevents,\u201d or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to\neliminate earnings volatility. As a result, significant changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, or interest rates\nas well as increased material, freight, logistics, and similar costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations. See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity and energy price, and interest rate risks. For example,\ninterest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt\nremain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary\npolicy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may\nimpact Ford Credit\u2019s ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. In addition, our\nresults are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.\nFinancial Risks\nFord and Ford Credit\u2019s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient\namounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.\nFord and Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived\ncreditworthiness. Further, Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other\nasset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit\u2019s\nability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk. Over time, and\nparticularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of\nreceivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints. In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases\nor originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to\nmanage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions. A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit\npurchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of\nFord vehicles.\nFurthermore, in addition to rising interest rates adversely affecting overall economic activity and the financial condition of our customers,\nincreases in interest rates could cause credit market disruptions, which have historically resulted in higher borrower costs and made it more\ndifficult to access the markets, obtain financing on favorable terms, and fund our operations.\nThe impact of government incentives on Ford\u2019s business could be significant, and Ford\u2019s receipt of government incentives could\nbe subject to reduction, termination, or clawback. We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various\nregions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or\nproduction. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits. The impact of these\nincentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or\nclawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial\nadverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Until 2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located\nin Brazil, where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment,\nincrease manufacturing production, and create jobs. As a result, the performance of our South American operations had been impacted\nfavorably by government incentives to a substantial extent. The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the\nfederal incentives we previously received, and the State of S\u00e3o Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia. See\nNote 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for\na discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral.\n23"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 24, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cIRA\u201d) provides, among other things, financial incentives in the form of tax credits to grow the domestic\nsupply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and other \u201cclean\u201d vehicles. The law\nlikewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them. These incentives are phasing in and will remain in effect\nuntil approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress. The IRA\u2019s incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the\nautomotive industry and Ford. The IRA authorizes tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components\nfor EVs and PHEVs and to purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles. Ford expects that many customers will be able to\nmonetize the commercial clean vehicle credit in light of Ford\u2019s range of electrified product offerings for commercial applications. When paired\nwith the IRA\u2019s tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Ford expects the commercial clean vehicle credit\nwill significantly influence commercial fleets in their evaluation of a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs.\nTo claim the retail tax credit, the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites, including that the vehicle must be assembled in North\nAmerica; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price (\u201cMSRP\u201d); purchaser income limitations; starting\nin 2024, any vehicle that contains \u201cbattery components\u201d that were \u201cmanufactured or assembled\u201d by a \u201cforeign entity of concern\u201d will be ineligible;\nand, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains battery materials that were \u201cextracted, processed, or recycled\u201d by a \u201cforeign entity of concern\u201d will\nbe ineligible. A \u201cCritical Minerals Credit\u201d is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are \u201cextracted or\nproduced\u201d in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is \u201crecycled\u201d in North America. A\n\u201cBattery Components Credit\u201d is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of \u201cvalue\u201d of its battery \u201ccomponents\u201d that are\n\u201cmanufactured or assembled\u201d in North America.\nAlthough we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general, the availability of such benefits will depend on\nthe further development and improvement of the U.S. battery supply, sufficient access to raw materials within the scope of the IRA, and the\nterms of the regulations and guidance (and the limitations therein) the U.S. government issues to implement the IRA, which will ultimately\ndetermine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof. For example, in late 2022 interim guidance was released on how to\napply the MSRP limitations to the retail clean vehicle credit, and subjected a significant number of SUVs to a lower MSRP limitation than the\nindustry expected, thereby excluding vehicles that may otherwise be eligible for the credit. Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their\nvehicles, as compared to their competition, will have a competitive advantage.\nFord Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected\nreturn volumes for leased vehicles. Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer\u2019s or dealer\u2019s failure to make payments according to\ncontract terms. Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal\nincome growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit\u2019s business. The level of credit losses Ford Credit\nmay experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. In addition, Ford Credit\nprojects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases. Actual\nproceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which\nwould reduce Ford Credit\u2019s return on the lease transaction. Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume\nand mix of vehicles returned industry-wide, economic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or\nreliability of the vehicles, or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes. Actual return volumes may be influenced by these\nfactors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values. In 2022, Ford Credit experienced lower-than-expected return\nvolumes. If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed Ford Credit\u2019s expectations. Each of these factors,\nalone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit\u2019s results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from\nFord Credit\u2019s projections. See \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Item 7 for additional discussion.\nEconomic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse\nthan Ford has assumed. The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB\nplans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants. We use many assumptions in calculating these\nestimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g.,\nmortality and retirement rates). We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with\nchanges to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred. To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may\nrecognize a remeasurement loss in our results, which could be substantial. For additional information regarding our assumptions, see \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n24"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 25, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nPension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford\u2019s liquidity and financial condition. We have defined benefit\nretirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees. We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S.\nemployees and retirees, primarily in Europe. In addition, we sponsor plans to provide OPEB for retired employees (primarily health care and life\ninsurance benefits). See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans. These benefit plans impose\nsignificant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity. If our cash flows and\ncapital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital\nexpenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFord and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising\nout of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise. We spend substantial resources to comply\nwith governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and\nother standards, but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations. In addition,\nas discussed below under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy,\nautonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations\u201d and \u201cFord Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations,\nconsumer protection regulations, or other regulations,\u201d regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our\ncompliance status. Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines, penalties, or orders that could have an adverse\nimpact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the operation of our business. Moreover, compliance with governmental standards\ndoes not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. In certain circumstances, courts may\npermit civil actions even where our vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other applicable law. Furthermore,\nsimply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to\nour products, services, or business or commercial relationships, requires significant expenditures of time and other resources. Litigation also is\ninherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results, including compensatory and punitive damage awards, a disgorgement\nof profits or revenue, or injunctive relief, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our\nbusiness in general. In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant\nadverse effect on our sales.\nFord may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy,\nautonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations. The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that\ngovern product characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within national boundaries. Further, additional and new\nregulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its\nimpact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice. These regulations vary, but\ngenerally require that over time motor vehicles and engines emit less air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, oxides of nitrogen,\nhydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Similarly, we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our\nprocesses to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable. As our suppliers make\nsimilar investments, those higher costs may be passed on to us. In the United States, legal and policy debates on environmental regulations are\ncontinuing, with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification. Recently, different federal administrations\nhave either sought to make standards more strict or to make them less strict, with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by\nthe last. Various third parties routinely seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts. In parallel, California continues to\nenact increasingly strict emissions standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles, and those actions are also the subject of legal\nchallenges from third parties. Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal, California, and other state regulators create uncertainty and\nthe potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly. In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose\nimport requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments.\n25"}

Risk Factors (Continued)\nWe are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum-powered vehicles and to offer\nmore propulsion choices, such as electrified vehicles, with lower GHG emissions. Electrification is our core strategy to comply with current and\nanticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets. However, there are limits on our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel\neconomy over a given time frame and many factors are involved that could delay or impede our plans, primarily relating to the cost and\neffectiveness of available technologies, consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix (as described in more detail\nabove under \u201cFord\u2019s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant\ncompetition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it\nis unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced\u201d), willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the\nappropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting\ninfrastructure for new technologies, including charging for electric vehicles, the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component\nsupply to make batteries and other elements of electric vehicles, and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new\ntechnologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive\nconsumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers, it may be difficult to meet applicable\nenvironmental standards without compromising results. Moreover, a production disruption, stop ship, limited availability of necessary\ncomponents, e.g., batteries or the raw materials necessary for their production, lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other\nintervening events may cause us to modify our product plans, or, in some cases, purchase credits, in order to comply with standards regarding\nfuel economy and air pollution, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and/or cause reputational\nharm.\nIncreased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more stringent\nenforcement programs, additional field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of\nfield data, and/or delays in regulatory approvals. The cost to comply with existing government regulations (in addition to the cost of any field\nservice actions that may result from regulatory actions) is substantial and additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or\nchanges in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix, as well as a non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-\ngovernmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols. The protocols could change, and any negative perception regarding\nthe performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales. Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation\ncould give rise to de facto changes in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations, thereby imposing new burdens on\nmanufacturers. For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business, see the \u201cGovernmental Standards\u201d discussion in \u201cItem 1.\nBusiness\u201d above.\nWe and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies, and the U.S. and foreign governments are continuing to\ndevelop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles. The evolution of the regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles, and\nthe pace of the development of such regulatory framework, may subject us to increased costs and uncertainty, and may ultimately impact our\nability to deliver autonomous vehicles and related services that customers want.\nFord and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection\nlaws and regulations as well as consumers\u2019 heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information. We are subject to laws,\nrules, guidelines from privacy regulators, and regulations in the United States and other countries (such as the European Union\u2019s and the U.K.\u2019s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulations and the California Consumer Privacy Act) relating to the collection, use, cross-border data transfer, and\nsecurity of personal information of consumers, employees, or others, including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected\nindividuals of a data security incident. Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information,\nare subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country.\nAccordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to\nmodify our operations or business practices. Moreover, regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance\nand/or legal actions (including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a\ndata compromise, misuse of consumer information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection or privacy requirements. Further,\nany unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, cause us to expend significant resources, and\nlead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business and/or consumers deciding to withhold or withdraw\nconsent for our collection or use of data.\n26"}

Legal Proceedings.\nThe litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. See Note 25\nof the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of loss contingencies. Following is a discussion of our significant pending legal\nproceedings:\nPRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS\nWe are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging damages from injuries\nresulting from (or aggravated by) alleged defects in our vehicles. In many actions, no monetary amount of damages is specified or the specific\namount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum. Our experience with litigation alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts,\non average, bear little relation to the actual amount of damages, if any, that we will pay in resolving such matters.\nIn addition to pending actions, we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to us. We also take\ninto consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to litigation. Individual product liability matters\nthat have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the matter is resolved unfavorably to us would be described\nherein. Currently there are no such matters to report.\nBelow is a product liability matter currently pending against Ford:\nHill v. Ford. Plaintiffs in this product liability action pending in Georgia state court allege that the roof of a 2002 Ford F-250 involved in a\nrollover accident was defectively designed. During the first trial in 2018, the judge declared a mistrial, ruled that Ford\u2019s attorneys had violated\npre-trial rulings while presenting evidence, and sanctioned Ford by prohibiting Ford from introducing any evidence at the second trial to show\nthat the roof design of the F-250 was not defective. During the second trial in August 2022, a jury found that Pep Boys (the party that sold the\ntires on the vehicle involved in the rollover accident) was responsible for 30% of the damages, and Ford, as a direct result of the sanctions order\nprohibiting Ford from presenting its defense, was responsible for 70% of the damages, resulting in $16.8 million in damages being apportioned\nto Ford. The jury subsequently awarded punitive damages against Ford in the amount of $1.7 billion. We have filed post-trial motions and are\nseeking a new trial.

Legal Proceedings (Continued)\nASBESTOS MATTERS\nAsbestos was used in some brakes, clutches, and other automotive components from the early 1900s. Along with other vehicle\nmanufacturers, we have been the target of asbestos litigation and, as a result, are a defendant in various actions for injuries claimed to have\nresulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos. Plaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various\nhealth problems as a result of asbestos exposure, either from component parts found in older vehicles, insulation or other asbestos products in\nour facilities, or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet. We believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many\npreviously targeted companies have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims.\nMost of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles. We are prepared to\ndefend these cases and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long-standing position that there is no increased risk of asbestos-related\ndisease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on our vehicles. The extent of our financial exposure to\nasbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage awards. The majority of our\nasbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for damages; in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum,\nand the vast majority of these cases involve multiple defendants. Some of these cases may also involve multiple plaintiffs, and we may be\nunable to tell from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us (as opposed to other defendants). Annual payout and defense\ncosts may become significant in the future. Our accrual for asbestos matters includes probable losses for both asserted and unasserted claims.\nCONSUMER MATTERS\nWe provide warranties on the vehicles we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage and vary depending upon\nthe type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that\nare defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. We are a defendant in numerous actions in\nstate and federal courts alleging breach of warranty and claiming damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws. Remedies\nunder these statutes may include vehicle repurchase, civil penalties, and payment by Ford of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. In some cases,\nplaintiffs also include an allegation of fraud. Remedies for a fraud claim may include contract rescission, vehicle repurchase, and punitive\ndamages.\nThe cost of these litigation matters is included in our warranty costs. We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the time of sale using a\npatterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line\nby model year. We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.\nWe are currently a defendant in a significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles, including those equipped\nwith DPS6 transmissions.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nWe have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we (along with others) are or may be a potentially\nresponsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling, or disposal sites in many states\nand, in some instances, for natural resource damages. We also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites.\nThe amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could be significant. Any legal proceeding arising under any\nfederal, state, or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for\nthe purpose of protecting the environment, in which (i) a governmental authority is a party, and (ii) we believe there is the possibility of monetary\nsanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) in excess of $1,000,000 is described herein.\nOn June 16, 2022, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cNJDEP\u201d) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey\n(Bergen County) seeking natural resource damages and other claims related to the Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site located in Ringwood, New\nJersey. We are defending the NJDEP\u2019s allegations and have filed a motion to dismiss.\n30"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 31, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings (Continued)\nCLASS ACTIONS\nIn light of the fact that few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have been certified by the courts as class actions, in\ngeneral we list those actions that (i) have been certified as a class action by a court of competent jurisdiction (and any additional purported class\nactions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and certified class), and (ii) have more than a remote risk of loss, and such loss\nwould likely be significant if the action is resolved unfavorably to us. At this time, we have no such class actions filed against us.\nOTHER MATTERS\nBrazilian Tax Matters. One Brazilian state (S\u00e3o Paulo) and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax\nassessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda. (\u201cFord Brazil\u201d) related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its\noperations in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The S\u00e3o Paulo assessment is part of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil. The federal\nlegislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end that conflict, and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for\nresolution. Ford Brazil continues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the\nstates to be resolved under that framework. The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation.\nAll of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction. To proceed with an appeal\nwithin the judicial court system, an appellant may be required to post collateral. To date, we have not been required to post any collateral. If we\nare required to post collateral, which could be in excess of $1 billion, we expect it to be in the form of fixed assets, surety bonds, and/or letters of\ncredit, but we may be required to post cash collateral. Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years, we consider our\noverall risk of loss to be remote.\nTransit Connect Customs Penalty Notice. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) ruled in 2013 that Transit Connects imported as\npassenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25% duty applicable to cargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% duty\napplicable to passenger vehicles. We filed a challenge in the U.S. Court of International Trade (\u201cCIT\u201d), and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017. CBP\nsubsequently filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled in favor of CBP. Following the U.S.\nSupreme Court\u2019s denial of our petition for a writ of certiorari in 2020, we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports, plus interest, and\ndisclosed that CBP might assert a claim for penalties. Subsequently, CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22, 2021, and on November\n18, 2021, CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of $1.3 billion and additional duties of $181 million, plus interest. We intend to vigorously\ndefend our actions and contest payment of the penalty and the additional duties.\nEuropean Commission and U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Matter. On March 15, 2022, the European Commission (the\n\u201cCommission\u201d) and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the \u201cCMA\u201d) conducted unannounced inspections at the premises of, and sent\nformal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the automotive sector, including Ford. The inspections and\nrequests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the collection, treatment, and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans (\u201cELVs\u201d). We\nunderstand that the scope of the investigations includes determining whether manufacturers and importers of passenger cars and vans agreed\nto an approach to (i) the compensation of ELV collection, treatment, and recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability\nor recoverability of ELVs in marketing materials, and whether such conduct violates relevant competition laws. If a violation is found, a broad\nrange of remedies is potentially available to the Commission and/or CMA, including imposing a fine and/or the prohibition or restriction of certain\nbusiness practices. Given that this investigation is in its early stages, it is difficult to predict the outcome or what remedies, if any, may be\nimposed. We are cooperating with the Commission and the CMA as they complete their investigations.\nITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n31"}

{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 35, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "ITEM 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\nCOVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market\ndownturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. Outbreaks in certain\nregions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. We also continue to\nface supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production issues, in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage. Our\ninconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to our suppliers\u2019 operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production\nshortfalls. Further, actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers, particularly our lower tier suppliers,\nas well as our operations in Europe. For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions, see the Outlook section on page 73.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve,\nand other central banks around the world, in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates. Periods of monetary policy\ntightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency volatility, especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of\ntheir economic or monetary policy backdrop. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity\nprices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the\nfinancial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most\nmarkets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to\nremain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments.\nPricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong demand, supply\nshortages, and inflationary costs. We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases as auto production slowly recovers\nfrom the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense\ncompetition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute\nto a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets.\nCommodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently\ndiverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum,\nwhile precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and\nmanganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain high. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To\nhelp ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing\nagreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the\nrisk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities\noperated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-\ncarbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing\nvolatility of oil and other energy prices. For additional information on commodity costs, see the Outlook section on page 73.\nVehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In\ngeneral, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments.\nFor example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120% of our total average\ncontribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government\nregulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that\naccelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen\nmargins.\n35"}
{"company": "Ford", "report_year": "2022", "page": 36, "source_file": "Ford_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nTrade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff\nbarriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant\nnegative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will\ncontinue to monitor and address developing issues.\nInflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures\nin the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although\nheadline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core\ninflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest\nrates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain\nat high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and\npotentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its\nability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.\nRevenue\nOur Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is recorded when control is\ntransferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our\nmanufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance\nobligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over\nthe term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or\nstand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be\nperformed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount, exercisable at the option of the\ncustomer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at\nauction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer.\nMost of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the\nwholesale receivable related to a dealer\u2019s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the\ndealer\u2019s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the\nvehicle to a retail customer.\nOur Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue\nfrom interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of\ncertain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nTransactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special\nretail financing and lease incentives to dealers\u2019 customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these\nincentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to\ncompensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive\ndirectly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer\u2019s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive\namount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to\ndepreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and\nFord Credit segments.\n36"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCosts and Expenses\nOur income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and\n(ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and\ndistribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs\n(including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and\nproduction of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We\ninclude within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our\nvehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.\nCertain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production\nvolume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout\nthe year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production\nvolumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of\nconsumer credit and cost of fuel.\nAs a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in\norder to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the\nfollowing categories:\n\u2022 Contribution Costs \u2013 these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty,\nand freight and duty costs.\n\u2022 Structural Costs \u2013 these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include\nmanufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information\ntechnology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs.\nWhile contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are\nimpacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the\ndifferent elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital\nspending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be\nimpacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases.\nOther structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production\nvolume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to\nexternal factors.\nWe consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to\ngrow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our\nmarket share.\nCost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2022 were $145.3 billion. Our Automotive segment\u2019s material and\ncommodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest\nabsolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs.\n37"}

This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its\nreview of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.\n38"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nDefinitions and Information Regarding Automotive Causal Factors\nIn general, we measure year-over-year change in Automotive segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost\nvariances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange:\n\u2022 Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units):\n\u25e6 Volume and Mix \u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin\nper unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in\nproduct mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line\n\u25e6 Net Pricing \u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs\nsuch as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory\n\u2022 Cost:\n\u25e6 Contribution Costs \u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume,\nsuch as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs\n\u25e6 Structural Costs \u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly\nproportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories:\n\u25aa Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant\noverhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating\npattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules\n\u25aa Engineering and Connectivity \u2013 consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials,\ntesting, and outside engineering and software services\n\u25aa Spending-Related \u2013 consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also\nincludes asset retirements and operating leases\n\u25aa Advertising and Sales Promotions \u2013 includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and\npromotional events, and auto shows\n\u25aa Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling \u2013 includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related\nto our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions\n\u25aa Pension and OPEB \u2013 consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs\n\u2022 Exchange \u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of\nremeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our\nforeign currency hedging\n\u2022 Other \u2013 includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related\nchanges\nIn addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include:\n\u2022 Wholesales and Revenue \u2013 wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an\nunconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units\ndistributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd.\n(\u201cJMC\u201d), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase\noption (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g.,\nconsignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford\nbadged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue\n\u2022 Industry Volume and Market Share \u2013 based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks\n\u2022 SAAR \u2013 seasonally adjusted annual rate\n45"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nMobility Segment\nThe Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicles and related businesses, Ford\u2019s equity ownership\nin Argo AI (a developer of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and investments.\nIn our Mobility segment, our 2022 EBIT loss improved $104 million from a year ago. The $926 million EBIT loss reflects our strategic\ninvestments in our autonomous vehicle capabilities and support of our mobility initiatives.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being developed by Argo AI to\nadvanced L2/L3 systems, which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the\nfuture. Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other\nmacroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess\nmarket interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage\nArgo AI\u2019s technology, Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our\ninvestment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4\ntechnology through Argo AI. Accordingly, in the second half of 2022, we recorded as a special item a $2.7 billion pre-tax impairment on our Argo\nAI investment, and on October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations, which is in progress.\n46"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nDefinitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors\nIn general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit\u2019s EBT using the causal factors listed below:\n\u2022 Volume and Mix:\n\u25e6 Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for\ncredit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes\nare primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing\nand operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the\nlevel of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of\ncost-effective funding\n\u25e6 Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit\u2019s\naverage net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region\n\u2022 Financing Margin:\n\u25e6 Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net\nreceivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and\ncountry level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the\nperiod, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period\n\u25e6 Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level\nof market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are\nprimarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management\n\u2022 Credit Loss:\n\u25e6 Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the\nprovision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses\n\u25e6 Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the\nallowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the\ncomposition and size of Ford Credit\u2019s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward\nlooking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d\nsection of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report\n\u2022 Lease Residual:\n\u25e6 Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits\nresidual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation\n\u25e6 Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference\nbetween the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the\nvehicles sold.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWith respect to \u201cChanges in working capital,\u201d in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our\ntrade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles\nto dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-\nstandard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the\ncorresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and\nthe corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of\nproduction at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our\ncash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly\nplants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances\ngenerally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences\nassociated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore\ninventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this\ntypically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.\nOur finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in\nhigher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit.\nIn response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in\nour production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to\nsecure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw\nmaterial suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to $6.6 billion in capital to\nBlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over $50 billion in electric\nvehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.\nThe terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they\ngenerally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period\nof time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of\ndelivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to\nsatisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based\non the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to\nsatisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024.\nFinancial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (\u201cSCF\u201d) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their\nFord receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier\nthan our payment terms provide. Our suppliers\u2019 voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the\namounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier\u2019s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct\nfinancial relationship with the SCF financial institutions. Moreover, we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was $253 million.\nThe amount settled through the SCF program during 2022 was $1.4 billion.\n63"}

At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit\u2019s liquidity sources\ntotaled $50.9 billion, down $1.3 billion from year-end 2021. Ford Credit continues to be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet.\nMaterial Cash Requirements. Ford Credit\u2019s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease\ncontracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional\ninformation on debt, see the \u201cBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile\u201d section below, the \u201cMaterial Cash Requirements\u201d section in \u201cLiquidity and Capital\nResources - Company excluding Ford Credit\u201d above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by\nFord Credit\u2019s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may\nbe subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies,\nuncertain tax positions, and other matters.\nFord Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash\nrequirements.\n67"}

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of\nexpected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative\ndebt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit\u2019s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance\nreceivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative\nasset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded\nand is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios.\nThe following table shows Ford Credit\u2019s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term\ndebt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions):\n2023 2024 2025 2026 and Beyond\nBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile\nAssets (a) $ 71 $ 97 $ 117 $ 137\nTotal debt (b) 58 83 100 121\nMemo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 8 12 11 17\n__________\n(a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other\nreceivables), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance\nactivities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments.\n(b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments.\nMaturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining\nlife of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the\ntable above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit\u2019s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above\nalso reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities.\nAll wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend\nbeyond 2023. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather\nthan amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2022, Ford Credit had $137 billion of assets, $60 billion of\nwhich were unencumbered.\nFunding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit\u2019s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including\ndisruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities and the effects of regulatory changes on the\nfinancial markets.\nDespite Ford Credit\u2019s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following\nfactors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence):\n\u2022 Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets;\n\u2022 Global capital market volatility;\n\u2022 Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit;\n\u2022 Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments;\n\u2022 General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers;\n\u2022 Ford Credit\u2019s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures;\n\u2022 Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit\u2019s asset-backed financing structures;\n\u2022 Inability to obtain hedging instruments;\n\u2022 Accounting and regulatory changes; and\n\u2022 Ford Credit\u2019s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities.\nStress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial\nobligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to\nquantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to\nunsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over\nvarious time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit\u2019s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or\ncapital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing.\n68"}

Of the $0.2 billion\nunderfunded status at year-end 2022, our funded plans were $4.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were $4.3 billion underfunded.\nThese unfunded plans are \u201cpay as you go\u201d with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S.\ndefined benefit plans for senior management.\nThe fixed income mix was 79% in both our U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans at year-end 2022.\nIn 2022, we contributed $567 million to our global funded pension plans, a decrease of $206 million compared with 2021.

The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by\nusers as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe\nthat these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-\nperiod results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due\nto possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.\n\u2022 Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) \u2013 Earnings before interest and taxes\n(EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to\nmanagement and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-\nperiod results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of\nmeasuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline\nfor each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows:\nPre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline\n\u2218 Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses \u2218 No minimum\n\u2218 Gains and losses on investments in equity securities \u2218 No minimum\n\u2218 Personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges \u2218 Generally $100 million or more\nstemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure\nto market demand and changing model mix\n\u2218 Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings \u2218 $500 million or more for individual field service\nfrom ongoing operating activities actions; generally $100 million or more for other\nitems\nWhen we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include\npotentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses\non pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.\n\u2022 Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) \u2013 Company Adjusted EBIT\nmargin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because\nit allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.\n\u2022 Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) \u2013 Measure of Company\u2019s diluted net\nearnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in\nnoncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items\nnot indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not\nprovide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that\nhave not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement\ngains and losses.\n\u2022 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) \u2013 Measure of Company\u2019s tax rate excluding pre-tax\nspecial items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for\nhistorical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an\neffective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are\ndifficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.\n76"}

The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our\nnext generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in\nproduction volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our\nplans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\nAutomotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles\u2019 affordability\nand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles\u2019\nperformance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features\nand delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\noperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers\u2019 liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current\nchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These\nmacroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our\noperating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust\naccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest\nfactories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will\nhelp enable future growth.\n34"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2023", "page": 5, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2023.pdf", "text": "As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our\ntotal deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the\ncost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and\ncharging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer\nsatisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\u201cNACS\u201d) and\nagreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer\ndemands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of\nour energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our\nMegafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of\nspecific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering\nexperience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we\nwill have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled\nelectricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time,\nand may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping\nmanufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger\nnetwork and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending\non overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital\nefficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all\nother continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital\nmanagement resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\nprovide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain\nand labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as\nlong as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\nAccordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\n35"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2023", "page": 6, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2023.pdf", "text": "The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\nreserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of\nfinancial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have\nassessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially\naffected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC\n606\u201d), including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-\nair software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration\nfor expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information\nthat may be available.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n36"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2023", "page": 7, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2023.pdf", "text": "Warranties\nWe provide a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted to employees and for our employee\nstock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock\noption awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our\ncommon stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely\nthan not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted\nfor permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in\nrecent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected\nfuture results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our\ncommon stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in\nbusiness that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of\nfuture results considering all available information.\n37"}

In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes\npayable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in\neffect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to\nour tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\nexperience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations,\nsuch differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 Change 2022 vs. 2021 Change\n(Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 $ % $ %\nAutomotive sales $ 78,509 $ 67,210 $ 44,125 $ 11,299 17 % $ 23,085 52 %\nAutomotive regulatory credits 1,790 1,776 1,465 14 1 % 311 21 %\nAutomotive leasing 2,120 2,476 1,642 (356) (14)% 834 51 %\nTotal automotive revenues 82,419 71,462 47,232 10,957 15 % 24,230 51 %\nServices and other 8,319 6,091 3,802 2,228 37 % 2,289 60 %\nTotal automotive & services and other segment\nrevenue 90,738 77,553 51,034 13,185 17 % 26,519 52 %\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue 6,035 3,909 2,789 2,126 54 % 1,120 40 %\nTotal revenues $ 96,773 $ 81,462 $ 53,823 $ 15,311 19 % $ 27,639 51 %\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, Model Y, and\nCybertruck vehicles, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs\nand over-the-air software updates.

Our costs of revenue were also positively impacted by the United States\ndollar strengthening against our foreign currencies as compared to the prior periods and by the IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current year.\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $241 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year.\nCost of services and other revenue increased $1.95 billion, or 33%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was generally in line with the changes in services and other revenue as discussed above.\nGross margin for total automotive decreased from 28.5% to 19.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average selling price on our vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in our\naverage combined cost per unit of our vehicles and IRA manufacturing credits earned as discussed above.\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.5% to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense,\nother overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write\ndown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess\nof forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar\nenergy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems,\nmaintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n2023 compared to 2022\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.27 billion, or 35%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022, in line with the increase in Megapack deployments year over year, as discussed above. This increase was partially offset by an\nimprovement in production ramping that drove down the average cost per MWh of Megapack as well as IRA manufacturing credits earned during the\ncurrent year.\n40"}

For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly\nthan expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures.\nFinally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid\ngrowth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time\ndetermine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31,\n2023, as well as in the long-term.\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such\nneeds.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to\nbe used in the manufacture of our products.

A company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $5,152\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Company provides a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for\nthese products sold, which includes management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified.\nThese estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are\nthe significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency\nand costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s estimate of the automotive warranty\nreserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of\nfuture claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one\nof the following: (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an\nindependent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management\u2019s\nestimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management\u2019s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating\nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred.\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims\nwere appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in\ndeveloping an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain\naspects of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005.\n48"}

(\u201cTesla\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nNote 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d), we\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary\ncourse of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our\ndirect vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC\n810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity\nArrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,\ndetermining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts\nand finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes.\n54"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2023", "page": 26, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2023.pdf", "text": "Revenue Recognition\nRevenue by source\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAutomotive sales $ 78,509 $ 67,210 $ 44,125\nAutomotive regulatory credits 1,790 1,776 1,465\nEnergy generation and storage sales 5,515 3,376 2,279\nServices and other 8,319 6,091 3,802\nTotal revenues from sales and services 94,133 78,453 51,671\nAutomotive leasing 2,120 2,476 1,642\nEnergy generation and storage leasing 520 533 510\nTotal revenues $ 96,773 $ 81,462 $ 53,823\nAutomotive Segment\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet\nconnectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,\nwhich is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return\nreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback\nterms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are\nprovisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We\nrecognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\nRevenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized\nover time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer\u2019s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales\nrevenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to\nautomotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to\nshipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\nvehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n55"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2023", "page": 27, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2023.pdf", "text": "We offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs,\nwe originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the\ntransaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the\nlease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contract residual value at the end\nof the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been\nchanges to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as\nmarket conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles sold under this program was\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging\nprograms and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred revenue\u2014 beginning of period $ 2,913 $ 2,382\nAdditions 1,201 1,178\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts 17 (67)\nRevenue recognized (595) (580)\nDeferred revenue\u2014 end of period $ 3,536 $ 2,913\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as\nof the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $469 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. We had recognized revenue of $472 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize $926 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be\nrecognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have\nrecorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $242 million and $128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts\nreceivable, net, for the current portion and $1.04 billion and $665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term\nportion.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and\nclean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment\nterms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated\nwith them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory\ncredits was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Qualifying\ncustomers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to\nreturn the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458 million and $407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized\non a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases\n(\u201cASC 842\u201d), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to\nus during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease\nterm after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be\nexercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual\npayments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-\ntype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest\nincome based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue\nand $164 million, $427 million and $234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\nServices and Other Revenue\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell\nused vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle\ncomponents, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary\nto the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within\nCustomer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from\ncustomers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue\nexcluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n57"}

Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,\ncustomers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time\nusing the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\nexpensed as incurred.\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system\nwill meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\ncustomer payments amounted to $1.60 billion and $863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the\ndeferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $571 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance\nobligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to\ninvoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to\nperformance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.43\nbillion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $1.05 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nwe have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $31 million and $24 million, respectively, is recorded within\nAccounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $578 million and $387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-\nterm portion.\n58"}

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under\nwhich deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities\nusing enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\ndeferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual\nearnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary\ndifferences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.\nOur valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\nUnder GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such\namounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign\ncurrency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee\nservices received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is\nestimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the\nrisk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of\nRSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during\nwhich an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options\nand RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n60"}

Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\narrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined\nthat the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a\nbalance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\u201cHLBV\u201d) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on\nthe consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV\nmethod, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the\namounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets\nof the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\ndistributed to the third parties. The third parties\u2019 interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling\ninterest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after\ntaking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least\nequal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the\nconsolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there\nhave been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due\nto changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been reached.\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-\naverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or\nthe if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders\nwhen their effect is dilutive.\nFurthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11,\nDebt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The\nstrike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the\nweighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and\ndiluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 14,997 $ 12,556 $ 5,519\nLess: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest (2) (27) (5)\nNet income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock 14,999 12,583 5,524\nLess: Dilutive convertible debt \u2014 (1) (9)\nNet income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock $ 14,999 $ 12,584 $ 5,533\n61"}

Costs that are directly attributable to the\nacquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and\nnoncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the\ntotal purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\nassumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of\nthe identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling\ninterests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash\nequivalents are primarily comprised of U.S. government securities, money market funds and commercial paper.\nRestricted Cash\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain\npayments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value\nguarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\n62"}

The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the\ndecline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our\ninvestments approximates its fair value.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing\nproducts to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and\ngovernment rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be\nuncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for\ncertain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to\napproximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of\nregulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected\ndepending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our\naccounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $207 million and $753 million, respectively, of long-term\ngovernment rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancing Receivables\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of\nallowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels\nconsidered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level\nof credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score)\nand other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant\u2019s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant\ncredit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n63"}

The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for\nexpected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current\nportion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total outstanding balance of MyPower\ncustomer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $266 million and $280 million, respectively, of which $5 million and $7 million\nwere due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for expected credit\nlosses was $36 million and $37 million, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash,\naccounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions\nor invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no entity represented\n10% or more of our total receivables balance.\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our\nproducts in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these\nsuppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the\ncontractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.36 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively.\nOperating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.38 billion and $1.04 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n64"}

In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of\ndigital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair\nvalue determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their\ncarrying values and the prices determined.\nImpairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment\nis identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets\nheld within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying\nvalue of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\nSolar energy systems in service 30 to 35 years\nInitial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs Lease term (up to 25 years)\nSolar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and\nplaced in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy\nsystems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement\nacquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\ngenerally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture 3 to 15 years\nTooling 4 to 7 years\nBuilding and building improvements 15 to 30 years\nComputer equipment and software 3 to 10 years\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the\nconsolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures\nare expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated\nratably over the identified useful life.\n65"}

Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the\nestablishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become\nsignificant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur\nthat could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we have recognized no impairments of\ncapitalized software costs.\nForeign Currency\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary\ncurrency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by\nthe different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional\nexchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other\nthan the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $122 million,\nloss of $89 million and gain of $97 million, respectively.\n66"}

We are required to comply with certain covenants,\nincluding hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction\ncosts related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any\nconstruction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease\ncosts of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of\noperations.\nGigafactory Shanghai\u2014Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we\nare required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai\ngovernment has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at\nGigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received grant funding of $76\nmillion. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property,\nplant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets.

This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are\nregularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also\nrequires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a\nsegment\u2019s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to\nall prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required\ndisclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain\ncrypto assets to be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other\nintangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto holding. The ASU is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the\namendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity\nmust adopt the ASU as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU will result in gains and losses recorded in the\nconsolidated financial statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it will\naffect the carrying value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, once adopted.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity\u2019s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not\nyet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial\nstatements, once adopted.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic\n805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from\nacquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had\noriginated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal\nyears. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023.

The ASU simplifies\nthe accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for\nconvertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives\nunder Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no\nlonger required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized\ncost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when\napplying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the\nmost significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share\nsettlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies\nfor a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or\nliabilities.\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $211 million cumulative effect of\ninitially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity\nconversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $474 million and convertible senior notes\n(mezzanine equity) was reduced by $51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of\nincreasing our net debt balance by $269 million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45 million related to previously capitalized interest.\nThe prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in\neffect for those periods.\nNote 3 \u2013 Digital Assets, Net\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets.

The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our digital assets held reflects cumulative impairment of $204 million.\nNote 4 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill increased $59 million within the automotive segment from $194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $253 million as of December 31, 2023\nprimarily from a business combination, net of the impact of a divestiture.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should\nbe determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which\nprioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\nII) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is\nlittle or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain\nof our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain\nreserves.\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRCF Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks to\nreplace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total\ncommitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for\ngeneral corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR\n(the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the\nsterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case,\nplus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the \u201cCredit\nRating\u201d) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\n75"}

Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each\nstock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free interest rate 3.90 % 3.11 % 0.66 %\nExpected term (in years) 4.5 4.1 4.3\nExpected volatility 63 % 63 % 59 %\nDividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 %\nGrant date fair value per share $ 121.62 $ 114.51 $ 128.02\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of\nour common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each\ngrant\u2019s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average\nof the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n81"}

CRD\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD,\nalleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was\nsubject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery.\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the\nCRD\u2019s allegations.

{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2023", "page": 60, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2023.pdf", "text": "Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other\nconsumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on\nSeptember 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging various claims about the Company\u2019s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later\nconsolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and\nother relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class\naction complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same\ndefendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to\namend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a\npreliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term \u201cFull Self-Driving Capability\u201d (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD\nCapability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the\naccuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a\npreliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On\nOctober 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. On\nOctober 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego\nCounty case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California.\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk\nand certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about\nthe Company\u2019s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock\nbetween February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as\ndefendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several\nsimilar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates\nfederal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid\nTesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated\namended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17,\n2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12,\n2023, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs have also appealed the court\u2019s arbitration order. Trial is currently set for July 7, 2025.\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the Department of Justice\n(\u201cDOJ\u201d), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology\n(e.g., vehicle functionality, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla\u2019s business, its personnel,\nand related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge\nno government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any\nongoing matters.

We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits\ncriterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect\nthe operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these\nVIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the\nagreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of\nthese VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash\ndistributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss\nand tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor\u2019s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or\nthe formula specified in the agreements.\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as\noperations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the\nfund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund\u2019s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021,\nwhich was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2022.\nOverview and 2022 Highlights\nOur mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully\nelectric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other\nservices related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and\nautomation.\nIn 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain and logistics\nchallenges and factory shutdowns. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and\ndeveloping battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to\nmarket and expanding our global infrastructure.\nIn 2022, we deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage products and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping\nproduction of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit and new\nbuild solar energy systems.\nIn 2022, we recognized total revenues of $81.46 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, compared to the prior year. We\ncontinue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our\nproducts and further revenue growth.\nIn 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.56 billion, representing a favorable change of $7.04 billion, compared to\nthe prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies.\nWe ended 2022 with $22.19 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $4.48 billion from the end of 2021.\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 and 2021 were $14.72 billion and $11.50 billion, respectively, representing an increase of\n$3.23 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $7.16 billion during 2022, compared to $6.48 billion during 2021. Sustained growth has allowed our\nbusiness to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods.\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook\nAutomotive\u2014Production\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the\ndate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nProduction Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status\nFremont Factory Model S / Model X Active\nModel 3 / Model Y Active\nGigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active\nGigafactory Texas Model Y Active\nCybertruck Tooling\nGigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production\nTBD Tesla Roadster In development\nTBD Robotaxi & Others In development\n32"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2022", "page": 4, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production\ncapacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on\nthe ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by\nmanufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to\nimprove vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability.\nHowever, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by\nthe new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component\nconstraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious\ntechnological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new\nfactory.\nAutomotive\u2014Demand and Sales\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles\u2019\naffordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. We will also continue to generate demand and brand\nawareness by improving our vehicles\u2019 performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and\nFSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as the Tesla Semi in December 2022. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit\nfrom ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness.\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and any future global impact\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the earlier part of 2022, the automotive industry in general experienced part shortages and supplier\ndisruptions which impacted production leading to a general increase in vehicle pricing. As the year progressed, inflationary pressures increased across\nthe markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially,\nimpacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in\nmany markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the\nmarketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our\nmomentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our\nvehicles, and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments.\nAutomotive\u2014Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on\nour total deliveries. Beginning the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicle transportation capacity during peak delivery\nperiods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the\nyear. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in\nmarkets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the\nproduction launch at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Austin. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to\ncontinue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our\nSupercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and\nefficiency of our servicing operations.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production\nof our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter\ndepending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer\ninterest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In\naddition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to\nmaintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the\nramp of Solar Roof.\n33"}

We are simultaneously ramping new products, ramping\nmanufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital\nspend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various\nproducts, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced\nprojects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to\nbe between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working\ncapital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\nprovide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting\nfrom changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding\nto continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\nOperating Expense Trends\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and\nimpairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to\nincrease operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to continue to grow in 2023 as we are expanding our operations\nglobally.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-\nbased cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and\nour view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules.\nAccordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to\nrecognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now\nor in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values\nof these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to\nthe carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period\nto period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial\nstatement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\nreserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of\nfinancial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have\nassessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially\naffected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions.\n34"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2022", "page": 6, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Revenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services\nthat meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n(\u201cASC 606\u201d), including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize\nrevenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point\ncontrol transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the\ncontractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values,\nwhen we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy\nprograms offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is\ndelivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other\ninformation that may be available.\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer\u2019s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive\nsales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related\nto automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related\nto shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control\nover vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their\nvehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the\ntime of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the\nend of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a\nright of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at\ncontract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle\u2019s estimated market\nvalue at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer\u2019s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly\nbasis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the\nlikelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may\nbe material changes to their estimated values.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not\nresult in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A\nsmall change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n35"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2022", "page": 7, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Warranties\nWe provide a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short\nhistory of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The\nwarranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy\nsystems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve\nexpected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other\nlong-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted to employees and for our employee\nstock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock\noption awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of\nour common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of\nindividual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we\nmay calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-\nbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income\ntaxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and\njudgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and\nadministrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to\ncorporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this\nregard. As of December 31, 2022, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely\nthan not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation\nallowance could be materially impacted.\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions\nand calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes\npayable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in\neffect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect\nto our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\nexperience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our\nexpectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income\ntax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is\nmade.\n36"}

This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory as well as the start of production at\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in 2022, at a higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales\ndespite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. There was\nalso an increase in production of Model S and Model X and an increase in the combined average selling price of Model S and Model X with a higher\nproportion of Model X sales, compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X began ramping in the second and\nfourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized $324 million in revenue related to the general FSD\nfeature release in North America.\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue increased $311 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of\n2022 for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had only an immaterial increase in automotive regulatory credits revenue.\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $834 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in activities under our direct operating lease program as well as an increase in direct sales-type\nleasing revenue.\nServices and other revenue increased $2.29 billion, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2021. The change is primarily due to increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used Tesla and non-\nTesla vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and\nretail merchandise revenue.\n37"}

This\nis primarily due to a decrease of $822 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is attributable to the lower stock-based\ncompensation expense of $844 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. This was partially offset by the overall growth in stock-based\ncompensation due to increased headcount. See Note 13, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. There was also a decrease of $87 million in overall employee and labor related expenses driven by a decrease of $340\nmillion of additional payroll tax due to our CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award in 2021, partially offset by an increase in\nother employee and labor costs from increased headcount. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $222 million in facilities-related\nexpenses, and an increase of $117 million in professional services, sales and marketing activities and other costs.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 8% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.

These changes were due to a decrease in allocations to financing fund\ninvestors.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our\ncore operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies\nincluding our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory\nNevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas and the continued\nexpansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities.\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our\ncapital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more\nslowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital\nexpenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources\nto fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also\nfrom time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December\n31, 2022, as well as in the long-term.\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such\nneeds.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials\nto be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and\nproduction ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts\nbeyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\u2014Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2023 Outlook\u2014Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and\nbetween $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an\nagreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York\nthrough December 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was\nmemorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). We also have an operating lease arrangement with the\nlocal government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end\nof 2023. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.02\nbillion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, our total minimum lease payments was $4.28 billion, of\nwhich $1.14 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note\n12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and\ninstallations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when\napplicable.\n42"}

In\naddition, we had $2.42 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2022, which included $2.27 billion under our\nCredit Agreement which was terminated in January 2023. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior\nto draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases,\nsolar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets).

Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and\nrelated servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage\nproducts. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating\nexpenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.23 billion to $14.72 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $11.50\nbillion during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and\nlosses of $7.65 billion, offset by the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $4.43 billion. The increase in our net operating assets and\nliabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,\npartially offset by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, to support the ramp up in production at our factories and larger\nincreases in other non-current assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Additionally, the increase in our net operating assets and other\nliabilities was partially offset by a larger increase in other long-term liabilities as compared to the prior year.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $7.16 billion for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 and $6.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly for the expansions of Gigafactory Texas, the\nFremont Factory, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Shanghai. We also purchased $5.84 billion of investments in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Additionally, cash inflows related to sales of digital assets were $936 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and net cash\noutflows related to digital assets were $1.23 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 from purchases of digital assets for $1.50 billion offset by\nproceeds from sales of digital assets of $272 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.68 billion to $3.53 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $5.20 billion\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.92 billion decrease in repayments of convertible and other debt, net\nof proceeds from issuances of debt.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating\nexpenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and\nNorwegian krone in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign\nsubsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically\nhedge foreign currency risk.\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the\nre-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany\nand cash and cash equivalents balances).\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary\nassets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would\nhave had on our net income before income taxes.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n46"}

The Company provides a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued\nfor these products sold, which includes management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if\nidentified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are\nthe significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency\nand costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s estimate of the automotive warranty\nreserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of\nfuture claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing\none of the following: (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii)\ndeveloping an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management\u2019s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of\nsignificant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating\nthe assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved\nevaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims\nincurred.

{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2022", "page": 24, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Tesla, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Overview\nTesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an easing of restrictions on social,\nbusiness, travel and government activities and functions. There are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, and we have been affected by\ntemporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product\ndeliveries and deployments. In addition, we have experienced and are experiencing the impacts of varying levels of inflation caused by the COVID\u201019\npandemic and general global economic conditions.\nOn August 5, 2022, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock by 4,000,000,000 shares and our Board of Directors declared\nthe 2022 Stock Split. Each stockholder of record on August 17, 2022 received a dividend of two additional shares of common stock for each then-held\nshare, distributed after close of trading on August 24, 2022. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to\nreflect the impact of the 2022 Stock Split.\nNote 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d), we\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the\nordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases\nunder our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting\ninterests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve\ncontrolling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the\nVIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to\nthe VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a\nmajority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the\nVIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we\ncontinue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not\nlimited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and\nfinance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and\nthe accompanying notes.\n53"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2022", "page": 25, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Revenue Recognition\nRevenue by source\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nAutomotive sales (1) $ 67,210 $ 44,125 $ 24,604\nAutomotive regulatory credits 1,776 1,465 1,580\nEnergy generation and storage sales 3,376 2,279 1,477\nServices and other 6,091 3,802 2,306\nTotal revenues from sales and services 78,453 51,671 29,967\nAutomotive leasing 2,476 1,642 1,052\nEnergy generation and storage leasing 533 510 517\nTotal revenues $ 81,462 $ 53,823 $ 31,536\n(1) Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees,\nresulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees. Actual return rates being lower than\nexpected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our reserve of $365 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, which represented increases in automotive sales revenue. The net release or increase of reserves which impacted\nautomotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2020. Further, $324 million of the total\nrevenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAutomotive Segment\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services\nthat meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network\nand over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle\ntransfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales\nwe finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience\nplus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such\nas access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon\ncontrol transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the\ncustomer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue\nrelated to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related\nto FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our\nobligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party\npricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer\u2019s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive\nsales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related\nto automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related\nto shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control\nover vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n54"}

We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a\nright of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at\ncontract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle\u2019s estimated market\nvalue at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer\u2019s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly\nbasis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the\nlikelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may\nbe material changes to their estimated values. The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees was $91 million and $223\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $40 million and $91 million was short-term, respectively.\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software\nupdates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nDeferred revenue\u2014 beginning of period $ 2,382 $ 1,926\nAdditions 1,178 847\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts (67) (25)\nRevenue recognized (580) (366)\nDeferred revenue\u2014 end of period $ 2,913 $ 2,382\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied,\nas of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 was $472 million as of December 31,\n2022, primarily related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. We had recognized revenue of $312 million\nfrom the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of\nDecember 31, 2022, we expect to recognize $639 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of\ntransfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have recorded net financing\nreceivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $128 million is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $665\nmillion is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31, 2022.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy\nand clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\nrequirements.\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment\nterms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated\nwith them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive\nregulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288\nmillion in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\n55"}

At the end of the lease term, customers are generally\nrequired to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing\nrevenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $1.75 billion, $1.25 billion and $752 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had deferred $407 million and $392 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which\nwill be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842,\nLeases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the\nvehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end\nof the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably\ncertain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all\ncontractual payments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated\nwith the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the\ncustomer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a\nmonthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $683 million, $369 million and $120 million, respectively, of\nsales-type leasing revenue and $427 million, $234 million and $87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\nServices and Other Revenue\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, paid Supercharging, retail\nmerchandise and vehicle insurance revenue.\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are\nrecognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used\nvehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and\nmerchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\nPayments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on\nthe consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small\ncommercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and\ninstallation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such\ncontracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs\nfor energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales.\n56"}

Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by\nusing market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are\nincluded as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be\nrecognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar\nenergy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled\nwithin one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\nwarrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract.\nIn certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy\nstorage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable\nconsideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer\npayments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of\nvariable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional\nperformance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of\nrevenue will not occur.\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to such\ncustomer payments amounted to $863 million and $399 million, respectively, mainly due to milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $171 million and $93 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for\nenergy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when\nthat amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2022, total transaction price allocated to performance\nobligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $210 million. Of this\namount, we expect to recognize $12 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 25 years.\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have recorded net\nfinancing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $24 million is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and\n$387 million is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31, 2022.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record\nlease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of\nthe lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue\nrecognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these\nagreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity\ndelivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized,\nwhich is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to\nsuch customer payments amounted to $191 million and $198 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives\nreceived from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to $25 million and $27 million, respectively.\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales\ncommissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\n57"}

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense\nand charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-\nhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\nAutomotive Leasing\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type\nleases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of\nelectricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.\nServices and Other\nCosts of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs of paid\nSupercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense,\nother overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to\nwrite down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in\nexcess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of\ndepreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences\nare expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be\nrealized.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or\nfactor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax\nassets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of\nforeign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net\nincome.\n58"}
{"company": "Tesla", "report_year": "2022", "page": 30, "source_file": "Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "Stock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of\nemployee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance\nconditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires\ninputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment.\nThe fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over\nthe period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years\nfor stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual\nforfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of\nindividual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we\nmay calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-\nbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\narrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have\ndetermined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the\nmethodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing\narrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\u201cHLBV\u201d) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of\nthe noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method,\nwhich is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.\nUnder the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet\nrepresent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming\nthe net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance\nsheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties\u2019 interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in\nthe noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each\nreporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the\nmezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other\nassets. For certain funds, there may be significant fluctuations in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached.\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-\naverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or\nthe if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common\nstockholders when their effect is dilutive.\nFurthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note\n11, Debt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive.\nThe strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below.

The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as\nthe fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the\nacquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and\nnoncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the\ntotal purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\nassumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of\nthe identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling\ninterests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

The amortized cost basis\nof our investments approximates its fair value.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing\nproducts to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and\ngovernment rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be\nuncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for\ncertain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to\napproximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of\nregulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment\nterms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific\njurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $753 million and $627 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other\nnon-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancing Receivables\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net\nof allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels\nconsidered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level\nof credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.\n61"}

Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial\ninstitutions or invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our\nproducts in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these\nsuppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not\nresult in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A\nsmall change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the\ncontractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $6.08 billion and $5.28 billion,\nrespectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.04 billion and $773\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n62"}

We perform an\nanalysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of\none unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds\nthe fair value determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference\nbetween their carrying values and the prices determined.\nImpairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the\nimpairment is identified.

We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short\nhistory of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The\nwarranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy\nsystems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve\nexpected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other\nlong-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.

Customer deposits also include prepayments on\ncontracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposit amounts vary depending on the\nvehicle model, the energy product and the country of delivery. With the exception of a nominal order fee, customer deposits are fully refundable on\nvehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in\ncertain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded,\nforfeited or applied towards the customer\u2019s purchase balance.\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives\nare recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital\nasset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable\nassurance of their receipt.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we received grant\nfunding of $76 million and $6 million, respectively. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost\nof the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the\ndepreciation expense over the useful lives of the related equipment.\nNevada Tax Incentives\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada\nthat provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration\nof capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we\nwould receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle\nIndependent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each\ncase subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas.

This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract\nassets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date,\nthe acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted,\nincluding adoption in an interim period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the\nacquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting\nguidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which\nwe adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current\nperiod gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU would be\napplied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes\nmultiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate\nalternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. These measures may\nmaterially affect our consolidated financial statements, and we will continue to evaluate the applicability and effect of the IRA as more guidance is\nissued.\n66"}

Topic 848 provides\noptional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a\nlimited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The\nASU deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The ASU is effective as of December 21, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024. We continue to evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine\nwhether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis. We adopted ASU 2022-06 during 2022. The ASU has not and is currently not expected to\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). This ASU requires business entities to disclose\ninformation about government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by analogy to either a grant or a contribution accounting\nmodel. The disclosure requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheets\nand statements of operations that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item and the significant terms and conditions\nof the transactions. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure requirements can be applied either\nretrospectively or prospectively to all transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial\napplication and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2022.\nAdoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2020-06\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. The ASU\nsimplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other\nOptions, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for\nas derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those\nfeatures are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability\nmeasured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon\ninterest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible\ndebt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer\nallowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine\nwhether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are\nrecognized as assets or liabilities.\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the\nASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of\nour convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the\nremaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant\nand equipment was related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted\nand continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as\nfollows (in millions):\nAdjustments from\nBalances at Adoption of ASU 2020- Balances at\nDecember 31, 2020 06 January 1, 2021\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 12,747 $ (45) $ 12,702\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases 2,132 50 2,182\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion 9,556 219 9,775\nMezzanine equity\nConvertible senior notes 51 (51) \u2014\nEquity\nAdditional paid-in capital 27,260 (474) 26,786\nAccumulated deficit (5,399) 211 (5,188)\n67"}

Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their\noption, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and\nonly during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a\nperiod of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the\nconversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per\n$1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our\ncommon stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur.

In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the\nconversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes\nwhich are scheduled to settle in the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase\n89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants\nwere intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions\nmeet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and were not accounted for as\nderivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional\npaid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of\neach quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter.

The note hedges we entered into in\nconnection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of\n2.4 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by\ncertain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced\nby certain reserves.\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRCF Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks to\nreplace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total\ncommitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used\nfor general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term\nSOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling,\nSONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate);\nin each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness\n(the \u201cCredit Rating\u201d) from time to time.

Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each\nstock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nRisk-free interest rate 3.11% 0.66% 0.26%\nExpected term (in years) 4.1 4.3 3.9\nExpected volatility 63% 59% 69%\nDividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\nGrant date fair value per share (1) $ 114.51 $ 128.02 $ 72.05\n(1) Prior period results have been adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. See Note 1, Overview, for details.\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value\nof our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating\neach grant\u2019s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the\naverage of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n2018 CEO Performance Award\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors\u2019 grant of 304.0 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the\n2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the \u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\u201d). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting\ntranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions,\nassuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date.\nEach of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market\ncapitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter\n(based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any\none of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA\nhave been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial\nstatements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest\nexpense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the\npayment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares\nthat he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any\nrequired tax withholding.\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2022 is provided below.

The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $1.73 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022, and increased by $6.14\nbillion and $974 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to\nchanges in U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2022 included\nutilization of $13.57 billion net operating loss carry forwards to offset our 2022 U.S. taxable income. We have $532 million of deferred tax assets in\nforeign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.\nWe did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We continue to monitor the\nrealizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective and\nsubjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based\ncompensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to\ncontinue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some\nportion of these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions\navailable in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years.

A portion of these losses were generated by\nour acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (\u201cSolarCity\u201d) and some of the other companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control\nprovisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect the change of control limitations\nor expiration dates to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had research and development tax credits of $969 million and $734 million for federal and state income tax\npurposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the\nstate of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of\n$197 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.\nFederal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an\n\u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $572 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a\ndeferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue\nService (\u201cIRS\u201d) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021 remain subject to examination for\nfederal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax\npurposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross\nunrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\nNote 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\nWe have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease\nand a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in\nthe State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and\nother costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured\non each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41\nmillion \u201cprogram payment\u201d to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is\nterminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses,\ncosts of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York\nthat we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are\ncurrently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues\nmeeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at\nBuffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to the\nSUNY Foundation.\n83"}

Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors as\nthen constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint\nasserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an\namount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party,\nwas approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously\nincurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs\u2019 previously-filed motion for\nsummary judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 previously-filed motion for summary judgment. The case was set for trial in\nMarch 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on\nAugust 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties\u2019 joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue\nexclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice.\nFollowing post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022.\nOn April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. The\nparties have completed briefing and argument will be held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023.\nThese plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include\nclaims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla\u2019s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and\nstayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk\nand the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached\ntheir fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things,\nmonetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion\nto dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the\nmotion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants\u2019 answer was filed on December 3, 2019.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021,\nplaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson\nmoved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal\nMusk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties\u2019 joint\nstipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class\nis decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the\nremaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b)\nopposed plaintiff\u2019s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a\ndifferent judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary\njudgment motions, stating that the court is \u201cskeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts\u201d and the \u201ccase is going to trial,\u201d\nbut that the \u201cparties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.\u201d Trial was held\nNovember 14-18, 2022.

The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified\ndamages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023.\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection\nwith Mr. Musk\u2019s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are now pending in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal\nsecurities laws related to Mr. Musk\u2019s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of\npurchasers of Tesla\u2019s securities. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board\nof directors. The now-consolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued\nbefore the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 22, 2019. The\nhearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April 15, 2020, the Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated to\ncertification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. On January 11, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary\njudgment. On April 1, 2022, the Court granted in part plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. The Company disagrees with the ruling and\naccordingly, on April 22, 2022, asked the Court for reconsideration or, in the alternative, certification to file an interlocutory appeal. On June 16, 2022,\nin response to Tesla\u2019s motions, the Court denied certification to appeal and declined to reconsider its opinion but clarified its summary judgment ruling\nto make clear that it had not ruled that any misstatements it identified met the required materiality element under the securities statute. The issue of\nmateriality and reliance will both be questions for the jury to decide at trial, which started on January 17, 2023.\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of\nTesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions\nconnected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things.\nFive of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported\nstockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then\nconstituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class\naction.\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things,\nthat board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company\u2019s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended.\nAmong other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys\u2019\nfees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 7, 2023.\nUnless otherwise stated, the individual defendants named in the stockholder proceedings described above and the Company with respect to the\nstockholder class action proceedings described above believe that the claims in such proceedings have no merit and intend to defend against them\nvigorously. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (\u201cJP Morgan\u201d) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of\na stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted\nthe strike price based upon Mr. Musk\u2019s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan\u2019s\nadjustment as a violation of the parties\u2019 agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP\nMorgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of\nthe adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit,\nasserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike\nprice that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither\nproper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which\nTesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court.\n85"}

Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict of $136.9 million against\nTesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla\u2019s Fremont Factory from\n2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury\u2019s damages.\nThe Court held a hearing on Tesla\u2019s motion on January 19, 2022. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla\u2019s motion in part, reducing the total\ndamages to $15 million and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022,\nthe plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, to commence on March 27,\n2023. Tesla continues to believe that the facts and law do not justify the damages awarded and is assessing its next steps.\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (\u201dCRD,\u201d formerly \u201cDFEH\u201d) filed a civil complaint\nagainst Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims,\namong others. CRD\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against\nCRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint\nwas subject to a sustained demurrer. Tesla has until February 3, 2023 to amend its cross complaint. The case is now in discovery.\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels\nthe CRD\u2019s allegations. Tesla is in the process of setting up a mandatory mediation with the EEOC.\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas,\npurportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust\nenrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other\nthings, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys\u2019 fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court\nconsolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to\ndismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants\u2019 reply is due February 17, 2023.\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\nWe receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,\nthe National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We\nroutinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and\ninquiries.\nFor example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk\u2019s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla\nprivate. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified\nin April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around\ncompliance with the SEC settlement, as amended.\nSeparately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no\ngovernment agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing\nmatters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business,\nresults of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position.\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In designing\nand evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and\nprocedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the\nbenefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are\nrequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Our management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

Non-financial risks could arise from operating risks such as the risk of fraud and compli-\nance risk. Risk of fraud is mainly identified in the area of misappropriation of assets. The Company has aligned\nits internal control and risk management system on financial reporting with the BMW Group policy. Risk\nmanagement is based on the COSO model, where the relevant processes include the early identification of\nrisks and opportunities, their measurement and the use of suitable instruments to manage and monitor risks.\nThe Company has established an encompassing reporting system that provides decision makers with compre-\nhensive, up-to-date information and insights into developments regarding the capital markets.\nThe Company has locally implemented the BMW Group\u2019s Company-wide Compliance Management System\n(\u2018CMS\u2019). CMS is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond Model, which defines specific prevention, monitoring,\ncontrol and response measures, on the basis of clearly assigned roles and responsibilities. The CMS is tailored\nto the Company\u2019s specific risk situation. It addresses all relevant compliance topics, including fraud prevention.\nAn effective and efficient compliance organisation is fundamental to reducing sanction and liability risks, as well\nas risks arising from other (non)financial disadvantages, such as reputational risks. The Company also imple-\nmented the BMW Group\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nBy regularly sharing experiences with other counterparties, we ensure that innovative ideas and approaches are\nincluded in the risk management system and that risk management is subjected to continuous improvement.\nThe employees of the Company follow regular trainings as well as information events, which are invaluable\nways to be prepared for new or additional requirements. The overall risk management process within the BMW\nGroup is managed centrally and reviewed for appropriateness and effectiveness by the BMW Group\u2019s internal\naudit department, which is acting upon this as an independent authority. Please refer to the BMW Group\u2019s fi-\nnancial statements for more detailed information.\nGiven the objectives of the Company, the Company is economically interrelated with the ultimate holding com-\npany, BMW AG, Germany. In assessing the solvency of the Company, the solvency of the BMW Group as a\nwhole, headed by BMW AG, needs to be considered. Solvency is assured by managing and monitoring the\nliquidity situation based on a rolling cash flow forecast.

The BMW\nGroup has good access to capital markets as a result of its solid financial position and a diversified refinancing\nstrategy. This is underpinned by the long-term ratings (Moody\u2019s as of March 26, 2021: A2 with a stable outlook;\nS&P as of August 5, 2021: A with a stable outlook) and short-term ratings (Moody\u2019s as of March 26, 2021: P-1;\nS&P as of August 5, 2021: A-1) issued by Moody\u2019s and S&P. The debt securities are guaranteed by BMW AG.\nAt present, no risks have been identified which could threaten the going concern status of the Company or which\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the net assets, financial position or results of operations of the Company.\nFurther, there are no special events that should be taken into account for the financial statements 2023.\nOperations during the year\nIn 2023, the Company incurred a gross loss of 507.0 million euro (2022: gross profit of 550.6 million euro).\nThe result of the Company is mainly composed of a positive interest margin of 26.2 million euro (2022:\npositive margin of 26.8 million euro) and a loss on financial transactions of 528.9 million euro (2022: profit of\n532.3 million euro). The negative impact on the result in 2023 is mainly due to the valuation of financial instru-\nments at fair value. Specifically, it is caused by the negative trend of the two-year euro swap curve and the\npartial turnaround of the positive financial transaction result from 2022.\nThe Company presented a stable interest margin of euro 26.2 million (2022: euro 26.8 million). An interest\nremuneration between the Company and BMW AG is established in order to ensure that the Company earns an\n\u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d net interest result for its financing activity based on its function and risk profile as a strategic\nliquidity reserve provider to BMW AG and its focus on the financing business of BMW Group. The Company\npaid a liquidity fee of euro 21.8 million (2022: received euro 65.9 million).\nThe Company\u2019s balance sheet total decreased by euro 941 million to euro 42,280 million by 31 December\n2023 (2022: euro 43,221 million). The Company\u2019s portfolio remains stable, and the decrease was mainly due\nto minor business fluctuations. Debt securities declined to euro 22,861 million (2022: euro 24,158 million),\nbut were offset by an increase in Liabilities due to BMW Group companies to euro 15,631 million (2022:\n14,112 million).\nThe chart below illustrates the main drivers of the change in assets and liabilities during the year under report.\nDuring 2023, the Company did not engage in any research and development or other events, and no such\nevents are expected to occur during 2024."}

This\nensured that the Company remained one of the BMW Group\u2019s most frequent issuers of corporate bond globally.\nGlobal developments and outlook\nBy 2024, the global economy is expected to recover from supply chain problems, energy crisis, and high inflation.\nGlobal growth is projected to reach 3.1 percent in 2024 and 3.2 percent in 2025. However, this forecast is below\nthe historical average of 3.8%. Factors such as increased central bank policy rates to combat inflation, with-\ndrawal of fiscal support due to high debt, and low underlying productivity growth are weighing on economic\nactivity. Inflation and commodity prices, which rose rapidly in 2023, are expected to continue stabilising. This\ncould potentially lead to an economic environment with more predictable costs for businesses and consumers.\nThe disruptions to the global supply chain are expected to be less severe than in previous years. However, chal-\nlenges to the global economy are likely to persist due to tight labour markets, ongoing conflict between Russia\nand Ukraine, tensions between Israel and Hamas, and economic disruptions caused by climate change.\nAlthough slowdowns and shortages are expected to ease, China\u2019s troubled property market, capital withdrawal\nby global companies, and restrictions on cross-border trade and investment could still affect economic growth.\nIn Europe, the risk of a recession remains. Real wages have fallen, leading to reduced consumer spending.\nAlthough energy prices have decreased from their peak, natural gas prices remain high, fuelling inflation and\nreducing the purchasing power of consumers and businesses. Electricity prices are also expected to remain\nrelatively high, which could further strain the economy. In conclusion, while there are positive signs of recovery"}

{"company": "BMW", "report_year": "2022", "page": 3, "source_file": "BMW_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "BMW Finance N.V. 3\nAnnual Management Report\nDear Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIn 1983, BMW Finance N.V. (hereafter also referred to as the \u201cCompany\u201d) was founded as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of BMW Holding B.V., who in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW Intec Beteiligungs GmbH,\na wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG, and incorporated in the Netherlands. The main purpose of the\nCompany was and is to assist in the financing of business activities conducted by companies of the BMW\nGroup and its affiliates as well as to provide financial services in connection therewith.\nDuring the year under report, the Company has successfully managed many challenges and embraced\nimportant growth opportunities. The Board of Director\u2019s gives an overview of these developments in the\nparagraphs below.\nThe Company\u2019s activities and risk management\nThe core business of the Company comprises primarily financing BMW Group companies priced in\naccordance with the \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d principle. Consequently, the main activities are providing long-term\nliquidity, and intercompany funding for BMW Group companies. Based on its activities, the Company has\nidentified the most important risks associated with its activities. The main categories of risk are credit and\ncounterparty default risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. Group policies,\nguidelines, control systems, and threshold structures are essential to making the Company\u2019s risk appetite\nan intrinsic part of the business, as they help minimize all the risks and control them at an acceptable level.\nFirstly, protection against such risks is provided by so-called natural hedges, that arise when the values of\nnon-derivative financial assets and liabilities have matching maturities, amounts (netting), and other\nproperties. Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the risk remaining after considering the effects\nof natural hedges. With regard to interest rate risk, the Company successfully implemented the financial\nstrategy of the BMW Group, which is explained in more detail in note 20.\nNon-financial risks could arise from operating risks such as the risk of fraud and compliance risk. Risk of\nfraud is mainly identified in the area of misappropriation of assets. The Company has aligned its internal\ncontrol and risk management system on misappropriation of assets and financial reporting with the BMW\nGroup policy. Risk management is based on the COSO model, where the relevant processes include the\nearly identification of risks and opportunities, their measurement and the use of suitable instruments to\nmanage and monitor risks. The Company has established an encompassing reporting system that provides\ndecision makers with comprehensive, up-to-date information and insights into developments regarding the\ncapital markets.\nThe Company has locally implemented the BMW Group\u2019s Company-wide Compliance Management System\n(\u2018CMS\u2019). CMS is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond Model, which defines specific prevention,\nmonitoring, control and response measures, on the basis of clearly assigned roles and responsibilities. The\nCMS is tailored to the Company\u2019s specific risk situation. It addresses all relevant compliance topics, including\nfraud prevention. An effective and efficient compliance organisation is fundamental to reducing sanction and\nliability risks, as well as risks arising from other (non)financial disadvantages, such as reputational risks.\nBy regularly sharing experiences with other counterparties, we ensure that innovative ideas and approaches\nare included in the risk management system and that risk management is subjected to continuous\nimprovement. The employees of the Company follow regular trainings as well as information events, which\nare invaluable ways to be prepared for new or additional requirements. The overall risk management process\nwithin the BMW Group is, although managed centrally, applied locally and reviewed for appropriateness and\neffectiveness by the BMW Group\u2019s internal audit department, which is acting upon this as an independent\nauthority. Please refer to the BMW Group\u2019s financial statements for more detailed information.\nGiven the objectives of the Company, the Company is economically interrelated with the ultimate holding\ncompany, BMW AG, Germany. In assessing the solvency of the Company, the solvency of the BMW Group\nas a whole, headed by BMW AG, needs to be considered. Solvency is assured by managing and monitoring\nthe liquidity situation based on a rolling cash flow forecast. The resulting funding requirements are secured\nby a variety of instruments placed on the world\u2019s financial markets. The objective is to minimize solvency\nrisk by matching maturities for the BMW Group\u2019s financing requirements within the framework of the target\ndebt ratio. The BMW Group has good access to capital markets as a result of its solid financial position and\na diversified refinancing strategy."}

The resulting trade disruptions and increased\ngeopolitical tensions led to increased uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. Despite these\nchallenging circumstances, we are pleased to report that our company's results were very good.\nThe year 2022 resulted in a gross profit of euro 550.6 million (2021: gross profit of euro 155.7 million). The\npositive result of the Company was mainly impacted by a positive interest margin of euro 26.8 million (2021:\neuro 26.3 million) and a profit on financial transactions euro 532.3 million (2021: euro 130.0 million). The\nchange in the latter is mainly driven by the fair value measurement of financial instruments and the effect is\nmostly caused by the positive development of the 2-year euro swap curve and increase of the cross-currency\nswap curves of various currencies (especially the RUB and GBP).\nThe Company presented a stable interest margin with a profit of euro 26.8 million (2021: euro 26.3 million).\nAn interest remuneration between the Company and BMW AG is established in order to ensure that the\nCompany earns an \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d net interest result for its financing activity based on its function and risk\nprofile as a strategic liquidity reserve provider to BMW AG and its focus on the financing business of BMW\nGroup.

The Company received a liquidity fee of euro 65.9 million (2021: euro\n88.6 million).\nThe Company\u2019s balance sheet total increased by euro 1,733 million to euro 43,221million by 31 December\n2021 (2021: euro 41,488 million). The Company\u2019s portfolio is stable, and the increase is mainly due to\nincrease of Receivables from BMW Group companies. The debt securities declined to euro 24,158 million\n(2021: euro 31,312 million), but were compensated by an increase in the Liabilities due to BMW Group\ncompanies euro 14,112 million (2021: 6,287 million).\nThe chart below illustrates the main drivers of the change in assets and liabilities during the year under\nreport.\n2022 2021\n50,0\n40,0\n30,0\n20,0\n10,0\n-\nFINANCIAL REC.

In addition to this, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict also had a significant\nimpact on the global economy. Despite these challenges, the Company has been able to maintain good\naccess to international capital markets and take advantage of favourable refinancing conditions. A broad\nrange of instruments on international capital markets, such as bonds, commercial paper, and other debt\nsecurities are used to finance the BMW Group companies worldwide.\nThe Company has successfully utilised the Euro Medium Term Note (\u201cEMTN\u201d) Program of euro 50.0 billion,\nthe euro 5.0 billion Multi-Currency Commercial Paper Program together with the 2.0 billion French\nCommercial Paper (Billets de Tr\u00e9sorerie) Program in the year under report with the objective to refinance\nthe BMW Group companies. The programs give the Company the ability to raise funds without significant\nadministrative efforts.\nUnder the EMTN Program, the Company issued two new debt securities during the year 2022 (2021: 2 new\ndebt securities) with a nominal amount of euro 2.0 billion (2021: euro 1.5 billion). During the year the\nCompany redeemed 15 EMTN\u2019s (2021: 14 EMTN\u2019s) with a nominal amount of euro 7.4 billion (2021: euro\n4.7 billion).\nIn 2022, the Company issued two Panda Bonds on the Chinese capital market, for an amount of Chinese\nrenminbi 4.0 billion (2021: Chinese renminbi 9.5 billion) and redeemed four Panda Bonds with a nominal\namount of Chinese renminbi 7.5 billion (2021: Chinese renminbi 5.0 billion). Through these public\nplacements the Company operated on its great advantage of tapping into the onshore Chinese debt capital\nmarket.\nFurthermore, the Company has access to the US capital markets through the issuance of 144a bonds,\nleading to even more flexibility in securing funds and showing its possibility to access the world\u2019s largest\ncapital markets. In the year under report the Company did not issue nor redeemed any 144a bonds on the\nUS capital market (2021: nil).\nThe Company also utilised successfully its French Commercial paper program and issued 24 new liabilities\nwith a nominal amount of euro 1.8 billion by the end of 2022, whereof the Company repaid euro 1.7 billion\nin 2022.\nDuring 2022, the global economy has shown signs of recovery from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,\nthough the situation remains uncertain and continues to be influenced by various factors, including ongoing\ngeopolitical tensions such as the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Despite these challenges, the Company has\ncontinued to perform well in terms of maintaining a healthy liquidity level and issuing corporate bonds. In\n2022, the Company successfully issued several types of bonds, including Euro Medium Term Notes\n(EMTNs), Commercial Papers, and Panda Bonds. These efforts have helped to ensure that the Company\nremained one of the most active corporate bond issuers globally, despite the challenging economic and\npolitical environment.\nGlobal developments and outlook\nSupply chain disruptions are easing, but headwinds remain. Heading into 2023, there are signs that the\nglobal economy is slowly recovering from pandemic disruptions. While we expect supply chain issues to\ncontinue to stabilise, there are several setbacks that could affect economic growth in the coming year.\nOne positive development is that the rapid rise in inflation and the rise in commodity prices are likely to\nstabilise or even reverse in 2023. Moreover, there are indications that global supply chain disruptions will be\nless severe than last year, with China normalising as the COVID-19 situation stabilised\nHowever, tight labour markets, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and economic disruptions caused\nby climate change, among others, will continue to pose challenges to the global economy. While we expect\nslowdowns and shortages to ease, high inflation and consequently higher interest rates will affect economic\ngrowth and Europe could possibly experience a recession. One concern is that real wages have fallen,\nreducing consumer spending in real terms. Although energy prices have fallen after their peak, natural gas\nprices remain historically high, fuelling inflation and reducing the purchasing power of consumers and\nbusinesses. Moreover, electricity prices are likely to remain relatively high for a long time."}

We expect companies to further diversify their supply chains,\nleading to further capital outflows from China and increased investment in other countries in Southeast Asia,\nIndia, Central Europe and Mexico. Although China is expected to experience a modest rebound, suppressed\neconomic activity may persist for some time, especially as the country struggles with ongoing pandemic\nrestrictions.\nThe ECB raised interest rates by 50bps for the 2nd time in 2023, bringing deposit rates to 3.00% as of 16\nMarch. Despite lower energy prices, overall inflation has already cooled somewhat but, after all, it remains\nhigh for too long. The ECB left open how many more interest rate hikes it has in store.\nAs of 2023, the war in Ukraine continues to cause human suffering and economic consequences. The\nsituation remains highly fluid and unpredictable, and the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty. One\nof the economic impacts of the conflict can be seen in high energy and commodity prices, which can affect\nvarious industries. The Company is closely monitoring the situation and is in regular in-depth dialogue with\nthe BMW Group departments and banks to assess the impact and respond to any possible unforeseen\nevents in a timely manner. The exchange risk of financial receivables is limited because all financial\nreceivables with Russian counterparties are fully hedged, and renewal of Russian borrowing facilities will\nnot take place. Additionally, the Company's exposure to non-repayment is deemed manageable due to a\nguarantee from BMW AG that covers aggregated losses on financial receivables up to euro 2 million,\nexclusive of any accrued interest. Overall, the Company's liquidity position is under control, and no further\nissues have been encountered or identified. However, the geopolitical situation and economic consequences\nof the war in Ukraine remain a significant concern for businesses and investors in the region.\nThe global economic outlook for 2023 is uncertain, with both positive and negative indicators. While some\nimprovements have been observed, challenges such as tight labour markets, geopolitical tensions, and\neconomic disruptions caused by climate change persist. Supply chains are showing signs of stabilisation,\nbut the future remains unclear in light of ongoing uncertainties.\nIn the light of the economic outlook and developments in the political environment, and the development of\nthe pandemic, as discussed above, the Company believes that it will continue to face a year full of challenges\nin 2023, for which it prepares through its risk management procedures and strategic guidelines. The\nManagement of the Company does not see any threat to the Company\u2019s status as going concern. The\nCompany\u2019s financial position is stable, with liquidity requirements currently covered by available liquidity and\ncredit lines.\nRegular in-depth dialogue with capital market participants has always been a high priority for the BMW\nGroup. Within a short space of time, sustainability has become a key driver for the financial market. Investors\nand analysts are increasingly considering environment, social and governance (ESG) aspects in their\ninvestment recommendations and decision-making processes. For the main features of corporate social\nresponsibility, we refer to the BMW AG group annual report.\nClimate change\nBMW Finance N.V.\u2019s exposure is solely through BMW AG\u2019s potential impact from climate change, which\nBMW AG mitigates through geographic and technological diversification of assets and the existence of\ndedicated areas and plans for Crisis Management and Business Continuity at corporate level, among other\nmitigation measures. No significant impacts are expected for BMW Finance N.V.\u2019s financial position. For\nfurther details, we refer to the BMW AG Group annual report.\nCompany information\nDuring 2022 the Company employed 16 people (2021: 16 people).\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is unbalanced since less than 30% of its members are female. The\nCompany\u2019s Board members have been appointed based on their qualifications and availability, irrespective\nof gender. In order to create more balance, the Boards will take these regulations into account to the extent\npossible with respect to future appointments of Board members."}

The ongoing war in Ukraine is a human tragedy that moves us all deeply. In\neconomic terms, the conflict has had a massive impact, with severe repercussions for vital supply chains.\nThe general situation was also worsened by repeated lockdowns in China and numerous bottlenecks\naffecting semiconductor availability. However, despite these adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic\ncircumstances, the Company performed well in 2022.\nMonitoring and advisory activities of the Supervisory Board\nIn our capacity as the Supervisory Board, we provided the Board of Directors with in-depth advice on matters\nrelating to management and further development of the Company and monitored the Board of Directors\nrunning of the business, both continuously and thoroughly. In 2022, the Supervisory Board convened for two\nregular meetings. Related to this, Russia's war against Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia with the\ncorresponding damage to economies around the world were discussed.\nMoreover, the Supervisory Board collectively and individually interacted with members of the Board of\nDirectors and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings.\nKey topics that were addressed in the Supervisory Board meetings were the financial statements of 2021,\nstrategy updates as well as the financial outlook, and the fulfilment of all risk and compliance requirements.\nFurther, the war in Ukraine and the Russian sanctions were addressed and discussed. Up until now, no\nissues were encountered or identified, however the geopolitical situation remains highly volatile and\nuncertain.\nDescription of the Audit Committee work\nThe Supervisory Board has assigned certain of its tasks to the Audit Committee.

During the meetings, the board report and audit\nplan of the independent auditor were presented. The full Supervisory Board retains overall responsibility for\nthe activities of its committee.\nComposition of the Supervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board comprises of four members: Fredrik Altmann, Caroline Philipp, Anne Brons, and\nJolanda Messerschmidt-Otten. The Supervisory Board is balanced as more than 30% of its members are\nfemale and its members have been appointed based on qualifications and availability, irrespective of gender.\nIn order to maintain balanced, the Board will take these regulations into account to the extent possible with\nrespect to future appointments of Board members.\nThe members of the board will continue to be selected based on their experience, knowledge and\nbackground. Future successors will be hired based on required qualifications for the job.\nThe external member of the Supervisory Board received a remuneration of euro 10,000 in 2022. No further\nbenefits, bonuses, or incentives were received by members of the Supervisory Board.\nExamination of financial statements\nThe 2022 Annual Report of BMW Finance N.V. as presented by the Board of Directors, has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V., as the Company\u2019s independent external auditor. The Audit\nCommittee carefully examined and discussed the proposed financial statements.

The\nsanctions imposed and the countermeasures taken in this context significantly restrict economic activities\nwith Russia and also have an impact on the Russian companies of the BMW Group.\nThe restrictions currently in place for payments mean that transfers of funds from Russia are limited.\nDevelopments in this area are reviewed by the Company on a regular basis.\nCurrent restrictions on transfers from Russia mean that the credit default risk for Russian group companies\nis elevated. In this context, impairment allowances were recognised on receivables from Russian group\ncompanies (note 4).\nThe Russia-Ukraine war also had an impact on foreign exchange markets, causing heightened volatility of\nthe Russian rouble (RUB) during 2022.\nSolvency\nGiven the objectives of the Company, the Company is economically interrelated with the ultimate holding\ncompany, BMW AG, Germany. In assessing the solvency and general risk profile of the Company, the\nsolvency of the BMW Group as a whole, headed by BMW AG, needs to be considered. The Board of\nDirectors considers it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial\nstatements based on a forecast analysis which supports the going concern assumption.\nBasis of preparation\nFunctional and presentation currency\nThe financial statements are presented in euro which is the Company\u2019s functional currency. Items included\nin the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which\nthe Company operates. All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest\nthousand, unless otherwise stated in the notes."}

The\nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors evaluated the financial position of the counterparties of loans to group\ncompanies and their ability to repay the notional and interest to the Company. The Company has not\nidentified events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going\nconcern.\nUse of estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain\nassumptions and judgements and to use estimations that can affect the application of accounting policies\nand reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The assumptions used are\ncontinuously checked for their validity. Actual amounts could differ from the assumptions and estimations\nused if business conditions develop differently to the Company\u2019s expectations.\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in\nfuture periods affected. Due to the current financial market conditions, the estimates contained in these\nfinancial statements concerning the operations, economic performance and financial condition of the\nCompany are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are\nbeyond the control of the management of the Company, which may cause actual results, performance or\nachievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Also, the estimates\nare based on management\u2019s estimates of fair values and of future costs, using currently available\ninformation. Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to:\n\u2212 risks of economic slowdown, downturn or recession\n\u2212 risks inherent in changes in market interest rates and quality spreads, especially in an environment of\nunpredictable financial market conditions\n\u2212 lending conditions to companies turning to the worse, thereby increasing the cost of borrowing\n\u2212 changes in funding markets, including commercial paper and term debt\n\u2212 uncertainties associated with risk management, including credit, prepayment, asset/liability, interest\nrate and currency risks changes in laws or regulations governing our business and operations, and\n\u2212 changes in competitive factors\nFor the valuation of financial instruments, the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the\ninterest rates and exchange rates used in the valuation models (note 20).

At the end of the accounting period the unsettled balances on foreign currency\nreceivables and liabilities are valued at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year-end. Exchange rate\ndifferences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, within Other financial income and\nexpenses. Quotations of market rates are obtained from Reuters Ltd. Real time rates are frozen on daily\nbasis.\nFinancial result\nThe financial result comprises the Interest margin, Factoring commission income, Other financial income\nand expenses and Result from financial transactions.\nThe Interest margin is the difference between Interest income and Interest expenses. The Interest income\ncomprises interest income on funds invested as well as an interest remuneration between the Company and\nBMW AG. The latter is established in order to ensure that the Company earns an \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d net interest\nresult for its financing activity based on its business models and risk profile as a strategic liquidity reserve\nprovider to BMW AG and its focus on the financing business of BMW Group. Interest expenses include\ninterest expense on borrowings. Interest income and expenses are recognised as they accrue in profit or\nloss, using the effective interest method.\nFactoring administration charges and other fee income is recognised in profit or loss at the time the debts\nare factored. The discount charge is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, taking into account the effective\nyield on the asset.\nOther financial income and expenses cover the exchange rate differences of the monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currency. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.\nA model is used to determine the impairment losses on financial receivables which is based on expected\ncredit losses and is comprised in the Impairment loss on financial receivables. More information on the\nmodel itself can be found under the paragraph \u201cImpairment\u201d.\nThe Result from financial transactions include changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value\nthrough profit or loss and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss.\nDividends\nDividends proposed by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the financial statements until the Annual\nGeneral Meeting of Shareholders has approved the proposal. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss\non the date that the Company\u2019s right to receive payment is established.\nIncome tax\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in\nprofit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items recognised directly in equity or in other\ncomprehensive income.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax\nrates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect\nof previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends\n(i.e. withholding taxes)."}

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is\nno longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\nEmployee benefits\nIn the financial year 2022 all employees participated in a defined contribution plan. The related costs to the\ndefined contribution plan are recognised as Miscellaneous expenses in the income statement.\nEarnings per share\nThe Company presents basic earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated\nby dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average\nnumber of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. There is no program\nwhich dilutes the number of shares outstanding.\nFinancial instruments\nCategories of financial assets\nThe categories of financial assets that are held by the Company are:\n- at amortised costs, and\n- financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\nRecognition and derecognition\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the\nCompany commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to\nreceive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has\ntransferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\nThe Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or\nexpired.\nMeasurement\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial\nasset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition\nof the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are\nexpensed in profit or loss.\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less\nany impairment losses.\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains or losses\narising from changes in the fair value for \u2018financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\u2019 are recognised\nin profit or loss within Result from financial transactions.\nInterest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and interest on loans and receivables\nare included in the Interest income and expense (note 2).\nDetermination of fair value\nSeveral of the Company\u2019s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for\nboth financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement\nand/or disclosure purposes. For the methods used see note 19. When applicable, further information about\nthe assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.\nOffsetting of financial assets and liabilities\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position\nwhen, and only when, the Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a"}

Fair value, which is determined for\ndisclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows,\ndiscounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.\nNon-derivative financial assets\nThe Company initially recognises financial assets at fair value on the date that they are originated. The\nCompany derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,\nor it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in\ntransferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as a separate asset or\nliability.\nFinancial assets at amortized cost\nFinancial assets are classified as \u201cat amortised cost\u201d if the following two conditions are both met:\n1) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to\ncollect contractual cash flows, and\n2) the contractual terms of the financial asset generate cash flows that are solely payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding\nAssets at amortised costs comprise receivables from BMW group companies, interest receivables and other\nreceivables. The fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present\nvalue of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest and relevant credit\nspreads at the reporting date.\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months\nor less.\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\nThe Company initially recognises debt securities issued on the date that they are originated. All other\nfinancial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Company becomes a party to the\ncontractual provisions of the instrument.\nThe Company has the following non-derivative financial liabilities: debt securities, loans due to banks, loans\ndue to BMW Group companies and interest payables and other liabilities. Such financial liabilities are\nrecognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial\nrecognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nThe determination of the fair value of the non-derivative financial instruments which are allocated to level 1\nare based on quoted prices in an active market. The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments\nclassified at level 2 are determined using a measurement model, which takes the Group\u2019s own default risk\nand that of counterparties into account in the form of credit default swap (CDS) contracts which have\nmatching terms and which can be observed on the market.\nDerivative financial instruments and hedging activities\nDerivative financial instruments are used within the Company for hedging purposes. The Company holds\nderivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. All derivative\nfinancial instruments are measured at fair value. Fair values are determined on the basis of valuation models\n(discounted cash flow models). The observable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are taken\ninto account in the measurement of derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s own credit\nrisk and that of counterparties is taken into account based on credit default swap values. Interest rate and\ncurrency swaps are valued by using discounted cash flow models. The changes in the fair values of these\ncontracts are reported in the income statement (in Result from financial transactions).\nThe Company applies the option to recognise credit risks arising from the fair values of a group of derivative\nfinancial assets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfolio-based valuation adjustments\n(credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative financial assets\nand financial liabilities are allocated using the relative fair value approach (net method).\nForward foreign exchange contracts are valued by using discounted cash flow models. Changes in fair value\nare calculated by comparing this with the original amount calculated by using the contract forward rate\nprevailing at the beginning of the contract."}

Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein\nare accounted for as described below.\nWhen the Company holds derivative financial instruments due to risk management policies, but no hedge\naccounting can be applied in line with IFRS 9, then all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately\nin profit or loss.\nFair value hedges\nOn initial designation of the hedge, the Company formally documents the relationship between the hedging\ninstrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the\nhedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging\nrelationship. The Company makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as\nthrough periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists\nbetween the hedged item and hedging instrument. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one\nto one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\nDerivative hedging instruments are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks and foreign currency risks\nrelating to debt securities and loans due to banks. Where fair value hedge accounting is applied, changes\nin fair value of a designated derivative hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement (in Result\nfrom financial transactions). In addition, changes in the fair value due to changes in the hedged risk only of\nthe hedged item are recognized in profit or loss and as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged\nitem (basis adjustment). The changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the hedge\nrelationship are recognised in profit or loss within result from financial transactions. Where cross-currency\nswaps are used as derivative hedging instruments in a fair value hedge, cross currency basis spreads are\nnot designated as part of the hedging relationship. Accordingly, changes in the cross-currency basis spreads\nare separated from the changes in the market value of the cross currency derivative hedging instruments\nand are recognized in a separate component of equity (the cost of hedging reserve) to the extent that they\nare aligned to the hedged item. Subsequently, the cross-currency basis spreads recorded in the cost of\nhedging reserve are amortized to the income statement over the term of the hedging relationship.\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for\nhedge accounting. Any hedging adjustment made previously to a hedged financial instrument for which the\neffective interest method is used, is amortised to profit or loss by adjusting the effective interest rate of the\nhedged item from the date on which amortisation begins over the remaining period of the hedge relationship\nbefore discontinuing. If the hedged item is derecognised, then the adjustment is recognised immediately in\nprofit or loss.\nImpairment\nFinancial assets\nThe Company applies the approach described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of all trade receivables in\nplace. IFRS 9 requires the implementation of an \u2018expected credit loss\u2019 (ECL) model, which aims to be forward\nlooking and requires to recognise an impairment loss for all financial assets as an expected expense. In\naccordance with this model, valuation allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets classified at\namortised cost are recognised in two stages. Impairment allowances on financial assets are measured at\ninitial recognition based on the expected 12-months credit loss (Stage 1). If, at subsequent balance sheet\ndates, the credit loss risk has increased significantly since the date of initial recognition, the impairment\nallowance will instead be measured based on the lifetime expected credit losses (Stage 2- general\napproach). The calculations of impairment allowances on receivables from affiliates are primarily based on\ninformation which is available in the market (e.g. ratings and probabilities of default) as well as on internal\nand external information on recovery rates. The Company generally assumes creditworthiness is impaired\nif a receivable is more than 90 days overdue. Credit-impaired assets are identified as such on the basis of\nthis definition of default. In the case of credit-impaired assets which had not been credit-impaired at the time\nthey were acquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime\nexpected credit losses (Stage 3). There were no significant changes in the assumptions or methodology\napplied in the assessment of expected credit losses, compared with the prior year."}

There is no preference share capital or compound financial\ninstruments issued by the Company.\nCash flow statement\nThe cash flow statement shows how the cash and cash equivalents of the Company have changed over the\nyear as a result of cash inflows and cash outflows. In accordance with IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows),\ncash flows are classified into cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.\nCash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement comprise cash deposits and cash at bank,\nto the extent that they are available within three months from the end of the reporting period and are subject\nto an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nThe cash flows from investing and financing activities are based on actual payments and receipts. While the\ncash flow from operating activities is derived indirectly from the net profit for the year. Under this method,\nchanges in assets and liabilities relating to operating activities are adjusted for currency translation effects.\nThe changes in balance sheet positions shown in the cash flow statement therefore do not agree directly\nwith the amounts shown in the Company balance sheets.\nThe Company\u2019s purpose is to assist the financing of the activities conducted by companies of the BMW\nGroup. This assistance is considered to be an operating activity for the Company. Movements related to\ndebt securities, loans due to banks and liabilities to BMW Group companies are considered to be operating\nactivities. The cash flow statement is computed using the indirect method, starting from the net income of\nthe Company. Under this method, changes in assets and liabilities relating to operating activities are adjusted\nfor currency translation effects.\nSegment reporting\nUnder IFRS 8 the Company is required to disclose segmental information of its performance. The interest\nincome and related income only derives from one segment. The Company derives its revenue interest\nincome by trading with entities that are owned and controlled by BMW AG and trading in derivatives with\nthird parties to hedge the market risks of the Company. Furthermore, the interest revenue is derived by\ncontributing to the liquidity requirements of the BMW Group. The interest revenue streams are related to the\nbusiness model of the Company.\n[2] Interest income and expense\nTotal interest income and expense for financial assets and liabilities comprise the following:\nin euro thousand 2022 2021\nInterest income on financial assets at amortised cost 833,936 465,952\nInterest income on financial assets included in a fair value hedge relationship 12,807 276,461\nInterest income on derivatives at fair value not included in a hedge relationship 141,588 8,281\nInterest and interest related income 988,331 750,694\nInterest expenses on financial liabilities at amortised cost (387,957) (270,668)\nInterest expenses on financial liabilities included in a fair value hedge\nrelationship (276,072) (304,781)\nInterest expenses on derivatives at fair value not included in a hedge\nrelationship (297,545) (148,959)\nInterest expenses (961,574) (724,408)\nInterest margin 26,757 26,286\nInterest income and expenses (paid and accrued interest) are recognised in the income statement using the\neffective interest method. Assets and liabilities at fair value stem from financial derivative instruments. Non-\nderivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount is adjusted for the\nchanges in the value of the hedged risks when the instrument is included in a fair value hedge relationship.\nFair value movements are not presented under interest income and expense, but under result from financial\ntransactions (see note 5)."}

This resulted in an impairment expense of 96 thousand (2021: euro\n13 thousand). In connection with the Russia-Ukraine war, allowances for expected credit losses on receivables from\nRussian group companies were recognised to take into account for the restrictions currently in place for payments from\nRussia.\nThe Company recognised an impairment allowance with Russian group companies for an amount of euro 530 million\n(2021: nil).

Therefore, the impairment expense related to the Russian loans resulted to euro 4 million\n(2021: nil). The impairment expense recognised is reclassified from stage 1 to stage 3 under the IFRS 9 expected credit\nloss model, as the credit risk related to the Russian group companies increased during the year.

The Company\u2019s\npolicy is not to take positions in derivative financial instruments with the aim of profit realisation. The Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement policy strives to achieve interest rate and foreign currency exposure neutrality.\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\u2212 credit risk\n\u2212 liquidity risk and\n\u2212 market risk\nThis note presents information about the BMW Groups\u2019 exposure to each of the above risks, the BMW Groups\u2019 objectives,\npolicies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the BMW Group\u2019s management of capital. Further\nquantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.\nFinancial Risks\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk comprises concentration risk and counterparty risk. The Company however did not recognize any concentration\nrisk and is not aware of the existence of a significant concentration of credit risk. The Company is exposed to counterparty\ncredit risks if an internal- or external counterparty is unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obligations. As\na general rule, the Company assumes that a receivable is in default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are\nobjective indications of insolvency. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the related provision. The\nCompany extended the days of overdue from 30 to 90 days given the activities of the Company which are mainly related\nto intergroup financing."}
{"company": "BMW", "report_year": "2022", "page": 36, "source_file": "BMW_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "36\nThe Company applies the general approach described in IFRS 9 and this follows and expected credit loss (ECL) approach\nto determine the impairment of financial assets. Since based on historical performance and forward-looking information\nthe Receivables from BMW Group companies are considered to be low risk, under the general approach, loss allowances\nare measured on initial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit loss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at\nthe end of the reporting period has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment allowance is measured\non the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 \u2013 general approach). Further disclosures relating to the model\nused are provided in the explanatory note 1 in the paragraph \u201cImpairment of financial assets\u201d. The measurement of the\nchange in default risk is based on a comparison of the default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of the\nreporting period. The default risk at the end of each reporting period is determined on the basis of credit checks, current\nkey economic indicators and any overdue payments. Loss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily on\nthe basis of information relating to overdue amounts. The loss allowance on these assets is calculated using the input\nfactors available on the market (i.e. Corporate Default Studies), such as ratings and default probabilities.\nThe amount recognised in the balance sheet of the Company for financial assets is the maximum credit risk in the case\nthat counterparties are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations. In the case of derivative financial instruments, the\nCompany is also exposed to credit risk, which results from the non-performance of contractual agreement on the part of\nthe counterparty. This credit risk, for Treasury activities is mitigated by entering into such contracts only with parties of\nfirst-class credit standing. Furthermore, the Company participates in a BMW Group wide limit system that continually\nassesses and limits the credit exposure to any single external counterparty.\nThe financial receivables from BMW Group companies are guaranteed by BMW AG when the aggregated losses on these\nreceivables exceed euro 2 million, excluding any accrued interest of these transactions. As a result, credit risk of intergroup\nfinancial receivables is substantially mitigated.\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date was:\nin euro thousand 2022 2021\nLoans and Receivables\nReceivables from BMW Group companies 41,838,877 40,609,375\nInterest receivables and other receivables 65,155 1\nMarketable securities - -\nCash and cash equivalents 1,041 6,236\nDerivative assets 1,314,786 872,316\nGross exposure 43,219,859 41,487,928\nGuaranteed by BMW AG 41,384,181 40,446,815\nISDA Agreement (netting with liability derivative positions) 876,201 458,569\nResidual maximum exposure 959,477 582,543\nDue to a debt monitoring collection system implemented by the Company no credit defaults were encountered in the\ncurrent and previous financial year. Hence all the Company\u2019s receivables at 31 December 2022 are recoverable at their\nrecognised amount.\nDuring 2022 the Company wrote-off the receivables with Russian group companies (note 4). This had limited impact, due\nto the guarantee that is in place with the BMW AG in case the aggregated losses on financial receivables exceed euro 2\nmillion, excluding any accrued interest of these transactions. The Company did not face any other write-downs nor\nreversals of write-downs. The Company has no further loans and receivables which are overdue. There were no past\ndues amongst loans and receivables and there were no collaterals received.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial liabilities when they become due, at reasonable costs\nand in a timely manner. As a result, the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity may be influenced, and its financing costs may\nfluctuate. The cash and short-term deposits as well as the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility of the BMW Group\nmitigate the liquidity risk for the Company. The diversification of debt instruments for debt financing reflects the successful\nfinancial strategy of the BMW Group. BMW AG unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all debt securities issued under\nthe EMTN Programs. Concentration of liquidity risk therefore doesn\u2019t exist, as the Company is using different types of\ndebt instruments with different maturity structures."}

Changes in maturity structure result from exploiting funding\nopportunities in a tense market.\nMarket risk\nThe Company is exposed to market risk, which comprises interest rate risk and currency risk.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk refers to potential changes of value in financial assets, liabilities or derivatives in response to fluctuations\nin interest rates. The Company holds a substantial volume of interest rate sensitive financial assets, liabilities and\nderivatives for operational, financial and investment activities. Changes in interest rates can have adverse effects on the\nfinancial position and operating result of the Company. In order to mitigate the impact of interest rate risk the Company\naims in general to change fixed to floating interest rates. Furthermore, the Company continually assesses its exposure to\nthis risk by using gap analysis, value at risk analysis, and duration analysis. Interest rate risk is managed through natural\nhedges and hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps. To manage the\nmaturity gaps appropriate interest rate derivatives are used. The interest rate contracts used for hedging purposes\ncomprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is applied, are accounted as fair value hedges. The economic\nrelationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based on the fact that the main parameters of the\nhedged item and the related hedging instrument, such as start date, term and currency, are the same.\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative financial instruments portfolio to manage the interest rate risk of its fixed\nincome financial instruments were as follows at the balance sheet date:"}
{"company": "BMW", "report_year": "2022", "page": 38, "source_file": "BMW_Annual_Report_2022.pdf", "text": "38\nin euro thousand Nominal Fair Nominal Fair\namount value amount value\n2022 2022 2021 2021\nEUR 91,782,101 (1,268,082) 56,590,406 354,844\nThe Company applies a value at risk-approach for internal reporting purposes and to control the frequency, extent, and\nsize of possible losses in such a way as to provide the minimum surprise. The approach to value at risk is based on a\nmodern historical simulation, in which the potential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are compared\nacross the BMW Group with probable amounts measured on the basis of a holding period of 250 days and a confidence\nlevel of 99.98%. Due to the aggregation of these results, a risk reduction effect due to correlations between the various\nportfolios is accomplished.\nThe Company implemented the Financial Strategy of the BMW Group. The objective of interest rate risk neutrality is\naccomplished when interest rate gaps are managed in a manner that the economic value of the portfolio of financial\ninstruments is immunised to a considerable degree against changes in interest rates. The Company monitors its interest\nrate risk exposure continuously and prepares a monthly report submitted to the BMW Group treasury department. A\nprimary risk measure when judging the interest rate exposure of the Company is the present value of a basis point change\nof the portfolio. This concept indicates the impact on profit and loss, representing the sum of discounted cash flows of the\nfinancial instruments, by assuming a parallel shift of the interest rate curve of one basis point. Looking at this primary risk\nmeasure, the interest rate risk of a shift of one basis point on 31 December 2022 was euro 95,159 negative (2021: euro\n97,746 positive).\nIn view of the plans to reform and replace certain benchmark interest rates, the timing and exact nature of these changes\nis currently subject to uncertainty. Across the BMW Group, a considerable number of contracts are directly affected by\nthe benchmark interest rates reform. Hedging relationships entered into by the BMW Group are mainly based on\nEURIBOR benchmark interest rates, which are designated as hedged risks in fair value hedging relationships. The\nhedging relationships affected are subject to uncertainty with respect to the identifiability of the designated benchmark\ninterest rates. The transition to the newly created or revised benchmark rates is being managed and monitored as part of\na multidisciplinary project. The conversion project will involve making changes to systems, processes, risk and valuation\nmodels, as well as dealing with the associated accounting implications. The uncertainty arising from the benchmark\ninterest rate reform is likely to continue to exist up to the end of 2023.\nCurrency risk\nCurrency risk or exchange rate risk refers to potential changes of value in financial assets, liabilities or derivatives in\nresponse to fluctuations in exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates can have adverse effects on the financial position\nand operating result of the Company. In order to mitigate the impact of currency risk arising from operational, financial\nand investment activities, the Company continually assesses its exposure to this risk. Currency risk is managed and\nhedged through the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and cross currency swaps. The economic\nrelationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they are\ndenominated in the same currency, same amount and have the same maturities. The Company has minor unhedged\nforeign currency debt positions. These positions are causing the exchange rate result displayed in the profit and loss\naccount as explained in Note 3."}

Risks mainly result from the use of IT systems and information\ntechnology. The Company uses IT systems to monitor financial positions and daily cash flows and to process payments\nto internal and external counterparties. System failures can, therefore, lead to delays in payment processes. Further\noperating risks can arise in connection with the settlement of financial transactions. The management of daily cash flows\nat the Company depends on the timely receipt of funds from external institutions who act as counterparties to financial\ntransactions, such as bonds, swaps or other derivative financial instruments. To avoid negative impacts of system failures,\nall key systems are set up in parallel and/or backup facilities or available within the BMW Group. Likewise, the security of\nall IT systems is continuously and thoroughly checked, to ensure a high level of information safety is maintained at all\ntimes.\nBusiness Continuity Management (BCM) aims to minimise the effects of emergencies and crises, and to (initially) ensure\nthe survival of the Company at the level of an emergency operation, thus safeguarding stakeholders\u2019 interest and the\norganisation\u2019s reputation and value-creating activities. BCM focusses on:\n\u2022 analysing threats and the business impact of emergencies and crises\n\u2022 determining the strategies and solutions to be applied in the event of a crisis, such as business recovery, crisis\nmanagement and IT disaster recovery planning, so as to enable continuity of business operations\n\u2022 documenting and periodically assessing these strategies and solutions\nBusiness continuity mitigation controls, such as business continuity plans, crisis management, business relocation plans\nand IT disaster recovery plans are in place to prepare and deal with incidents and crises threatening the continuity of\ncritical business processes.\nImpact of the coronavirus\nEconomically, many countries have been significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in recent years, including\nunemployment, business closures and disruptions to global trade. With the pandemic slowing down in many parts of the\nworld, its economic impact is also diminishing.\nFor the Company itself, the effects of the Coronavirus have been limited and no increased financial risks were identified\nin 2022. Therefore, the going concern status of the Company has been safeguarded.\nRussian-Ukrainian conflict\nAs of 2023, the war in Ukraine continues to cause human suffering and economic consequences. The situation remains\nhighly fluid and unpredictable, and the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty. One of the economic impacts of\nthe conflict can be seen in high energy and commodity prices, which can affect various industries. The Company is\nclosely monitoring the situation and is in regular in-depth dialogue with the BMW Group departments and banks to\nassess the impact and respond to any possible unforeseen events in a timely manner. The exchange risk of financial\nreceivables is limited because all financial receivables with Russian counterparties are fully hedged, and renewal of\nRussian borrowing facilities will not take place. Additionally, the Company's exposure to non-repayment is deemed\nmanageable due to a guarantee from BMW AG that covers aggregated losses on financial receivables up to euro 2\nmillion, exclusive of any accrued interest. Overall, the Company's liquidity position is under control, and no further issues\nhave been encountered or identified. However, the geopolitical situation and economic consequences of the war in\nUkraine remain a significant concern for businesses and investors in the region.\n[20] Related parties\nIdentity of related parties\nA comprehensive exchange of internal services between affiliates of a multinational corporation as the BMW Group is\ncommon practice. In its responsibility to assist the financing of business activities conducted by companies of the BMW\nGroup and its affiliates, the Company applies transfer prices for financial instruments in conformity with market levels and\nin accordance with national and international tax requirements (arm\u2019s length principle, principle of economic allegiance,\nseparate entity approach, Art 9 OECD-MA Rz 126)."}

For uneven maturities\nand maturities between Overnight and six months the method of linear inter-/extrapolation based on the available BMW\nCredit Default Swaps is used to calculate the appropriate credit risk with regard to market prices. To enhance efficiency\nand ensure consistency throughout the BMW Group, a transfer pricing sheet is provided monthly by the Middle Office,\nwhich is daily filled with actual data to calculate the credit and term spread for every transaction.

Furthermore, we identified the existence of the loans\nissued and hedge accounting as key audit matter because of the importance of existence for users of the financial\nstatements and the detailed requirements for hedge accounting.\nAnother area of focus, that was not considered as key audit matter, was (income) taxation.\nThe Company assessed the possible effects of climate change on its financial position, refer to the section \u2018Climate\nchange\u2019 in the Annual Management Report. We discussed the Company\u2019s assessment and governance thereof with the\nboard of directors and evaluated the potential impact on the financial position including underlying assumptions and\nestimates included in the financial statements.\nOur procedures did not result in outcomes contrary to the board of directors\u2019 assessment. Given the nature of the\nCompany\u2019s activities, the impact of climate change is not considered a key audit matter.\nWe ensured that the audit team included the appropriate skills and competences, which are needed for the audit of a\nfinance company.

These, together with qualitative considerations,\nhelped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line\nitems and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the\nfinancial statements as a whole and on our opinion.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at\n\u20ac432,000,000 (2021: \u20ac414,000,000). As a basis for our judgement, we used 1% of total assets.

Inherent to the nature of the Company\u2019s business, the amounts in the statement of financial position\nare large in proportion to the income statement line items miscellaneous income & expenses and taxes. Based on\nqualitative considerations, we performed audit procedures on those income statement line items, applying a benchmark\nof 10% of the total of those expenses.\nWe also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for\nqualitative reasons.\nWe agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them any misstatement identified during our audit above\n\u20ac21,600,000 (2021: \u20ac20,700,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for\nqualitative reasons.\nAudit approach fraud risks\nWe identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit\nwe obtained an understanding of BMW Finance N.V. and its environment and the components of the internal control\nsystem. This included the board of directors\u2019 risk assessment process, the board of directors\u2019 process for responding to\nthe risks of fraud and monitoring the internal control system and how the supervisory board exercised oversight, as well\nas the outcomes. We refer to section \u2018The Company\u2019s activities and risk management\u2019 of the annual management\nreport.\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the internal control system with respect to the risks of material\nmisstatements due to fraud and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct and whistle-\nblower procedures, among other things.

In\nthis respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with article 11 of the EU Regulation\non specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional\nreport is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor\u2019s report.\nWe provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to\nbear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance\nin the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

The EU Commission is not expected to publish official figures until November the following year.\n8 To improve year-on- year comparability, the 2020 NEDC figures were converted to WLTP after adjusting for permissible flexibilities \u2013 specifically from 99 g CO2 / km according to NEDC (including 5 g CO2 / km phase-in, 7.5 g CO2 / km supercredits and 2.4 g CO2 / km eco-innovations) to 135 g CO2 / km according to WLTP\n(excluding flexibilities). In 2020, a phase-in regulation was accepted, as was the recognition of supercredits.

The figures for 2019 (base year) and 2020 have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes (2019 before adjustment: 0.30 tons, 2020 before adjustment: 0.23 tons).\n12 Figures from 2017 and 2018 are audited with limited assurance."}
