"WarrantiesWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generationand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes ourbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claimsincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to ourhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not includeprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidatedbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligatedamounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warrantyactivity consisted of the following (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202320222021Accrued warranty—beginning of period$3,505$2,101$1,468Warranty costs incurred(1,225)(803)(525)Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreignexchange impact539522102Provision for warranty2,3331,6851,056Accrued warranty—end of period$5,152$3,505$2,101Customer DepositsCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or anenergy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments oncontracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities andother on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.Government Assistance Programs and IncentivesGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentivesare recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset.The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonableassurance of their receipt.The IRA IncentivesOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multipleincentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternativeminimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected tomaterially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily areduction of our material costs in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IRA as more guidance is issuedand the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements.67",Unnamed: 0,Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 6,Unnamed: 7
