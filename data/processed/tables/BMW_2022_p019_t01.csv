"relating to debt securities and loans due to banks. Where fair value hedge accounting is applied, changes"
in fair value of a designated derivative hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement (in Result
"from financial transactions). In addition, changes in the fair value due to changes in the hedged risk only of"
the hedged item are recognized in profit or loss and as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged
item (basis adjustment). The changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the hedge
relationship are recognised in profit or loss within result from financial transactions. Where cross-currency
"swaps are used as derivative hedging instruments in a fair value hedge, cross currency basis spreads are"
"not designated as part of the hedging relationship. Accordingly, changes in the cross-currency basis spreads"
are separated from the changes in the market value of the cross currency derivative hedging instruments
and are recognized in a separate component of equity (the cost of hedging reserve) to the extent that they
"are aligned to the hedged item. Subsequently, the cross-currency basis spreads recorded in the cost of"
hedging reserve are amortized to the income statement over the term of the hedging relationship.
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting. Any hedging adjustment made previously to a hedged financial instrument for which the
"effective interest method is used, is amortised to profit or loss by adjusting the effective interest rate of the"
hedged item from the date on which amortisation begins over the remaining period of the hedge relationship
"before discontinuing. If the hedged item is derecognised, then the adjustment is recognised immediately in"
profit or loss.

The Company applies the approach described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of all trade receivables in
"place. IFRS 9 requires the implementation of an ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model, which aims to be forward"
looking and requires to recognise an impairment loss for all financial assets as an expected expense. In
"accordance with this model, valuation allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets classified at"
