"Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 OutlookAutomotive—ProductionThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of thedate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:Production LocationVehicle Model(s)Production StatusFremont FactoryModel S / Model XActiveModel 3 / Model YActiveGigafactory ShanghaiModel 3 / Model YActiveGigafactory Berlin-BrandenburgModel YActiveGigafactory TexasModel YActiveCybertruckActiveGigafactory NevadaTesla SemiPilot productionVariousNext Generation PlatformIn developmentTBDTesla RoadsterIn developmentWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck andnext generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate andefficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of ournext generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we aredeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decreaseproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new productand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortagesand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline inproduction volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with ourplans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.Automotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and InfrastructureOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordabilityand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software featuresand delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector andincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and theenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprisecustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks indeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales ofvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust ouroperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have toadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by currentchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. Thesemacroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn ouroperating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjustaccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newestfactories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products willhelp enable future growth.34",Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 3
